You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author of kids, more read in America.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with clothes, and no one has never chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk about circles and <unk>
And you know an epiphany generally is something that you fell on somewhere else.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of what I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> at the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me enter the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret, it would do it.
For three years.
I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call, the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure we adults never get to know us.
You could engage Ohio and please bring that man that I know you have found.
And I have to tell you I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to tell you about this?
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we had <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got rid of her family, because it was necessary, because it was.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and went into my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it has been present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today that I talked about this today.
It also needs to -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water -- almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think it was about a <unk> on another <unk> on a <unk> snow after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or break the ice booms down.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and hold down to the end, whereas others can't get it more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> which are isolated apart and alone, largely as we see ourselves as a human being.
But the reality is the opposite.
As it melts into a <unk> I'm breathing its <unk>
As you melts a iceberg that releases freshwater rich on minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and will not have that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of your way for the life cycle.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to get really to witness a <unk> iceberg here.
You have it.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
It's about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby, OK.
Then, two couples with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much about the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception -- yeah, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome binds to the X <unk>
Both of these, and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity of the ground they turned two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people conceptualize the anatomy -- that -- of human bodies, and <unk> how they have considered the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role in my job is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or as I say sometimes, I would <unk> <unk> out of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenging social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex -- individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into male stem and feminine <unk>
In particular, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't fall into the common forms of male or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and it tells you the <unk> that we all have in the life that they become <unk>
And then in <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual has no receptors of testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body develops in a <unk> course of the body.
When you get older, you have a little bit of a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing tests they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think of a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women as I -- I consider a <unk> woman -- I don't know the <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome.
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, he had sex with her, he was a life as a boy and just found out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the twentieth chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> which is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know well why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies, would be <unk> twins or <unk> twins they are tested for surgery -- it's not to be able to get it from a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they are tested for various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity, it will be black, he means to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
A <unk> <unk>
And when we have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture vis-a-vis <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children born like two people in the same body.
The biggest case is last year with the <unk> South African <unk> <unk> <unk> was put in <unk> her sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test to determine if you <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to journalists that there is no such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we need to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women and women and <unk> and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go to science, the more we need to admit that these categories were -- were thought that these categories were <unk> directly stable categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology itself.
As we see, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved in science, we get more and more and more in a uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at first, and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to do it with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of he got to put a pen in front of the nose and if he was still <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to address the dilemma of determining a really death situation -- and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm liberal, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I put it nervous.
You know, that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we would think about.
And I think of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I am a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so sweeping in what they did, that I find myself every bit of looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they were talking about, was a <unk> concept, and I would compare it to another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as all of you remember, what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The world's old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the right idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
It was the idea that the political power was coming up with the local power of the father passed off the grandfather and then to the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replacing them by a new concept, and that concept was that all of the men are created equal.
They took the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences, that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> out of <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of ours, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were broadcasting the idea of <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid out the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people of color in color that are going to correspond to <unk> difference and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> thinking in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we had <unk> before anatomy.
I don't want to say that the age of five were allowed to have sex or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me, they make sense and I think we should be able to sustain it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two sentient beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before June June 1 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in the eastern side of March 1980.
By the only fact that he was born three months before Mary are being attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sex consent -- the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different time, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, all the virtue of being considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered <unk> <unk> of the Mary that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, on their hand, doesn't have the same rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every state with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So they still do <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science advanced so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of a kind of attitude that we say, "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people get stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas has been decided to get married with a man you don't have to have a chromosome and you have to get married with a woman to have the Y.
Now, in practice, they don't do tests for people.
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the first of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty one."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> on this to <unk> rights to people, because I will admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more sensitive and intelligent decisions about their sex relationships that people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And one part of me asks what if the character of one person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to continue this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed by being killed by being killed by a sex, in which case you are allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon who was talking about a couple years ago that had done to give birth twins <unk> and then pick it apart and then <unk> their name.
But when the phone asked the reason the operation of the operation, a very <unk> operation, he responded to me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and so he had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered political seekers instead of <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people who are <unk> to change the state of state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, I just want to say I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in my feminism <unk> I thought I was <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking <unk> <unk> so there is nothing else in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more I think about the question, I have something else in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So as well as the <unk> were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that they would have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we are far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to do it.
But the amazing thing about cities is that it is much more than their building cost.
So easily we could <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But we just went down to the apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already -- and that the other half will still get rid of it.
They could try to increase the capacity by <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid the pains and the causes of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, building an entire apartment building totally new, and when the rules of that place will grow up the construction instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that the governments to build new public reform major enough to contain cities, and I gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of being Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> I went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, <unk> <unk> <unk> took <unk> with a platform in which it <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say that you cannot go and pick all the current residents in apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but we need to have a lot of technologies like <unk> rules and usually the rules that prevent us move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed him to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, is worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> which is going to take away the rules that are going to happen there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for us to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five in January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
And so I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that was at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader approached the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be an option in a city that they might go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of kilometers away to the North.
And we also have new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from countries that will help them establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could be just a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19th of January, voted in Congress to <unk> its Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional <unk>
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February 17, passed again in another voting from <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting from 21 to 24 of February, an shifting of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is being built in North Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after that was four years getting <unk>
The other country was interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this way, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators <unk> and the time would be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow its Supreme Court to be able to be the rule of the last instance for this new criminal system.
There are urban builders and they are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've been solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies who wanted to go through the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to be living there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There is a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go and get good work, sometimes they're <unk> mothers that have to earn the money so just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What seems to you to think about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, <unk> asked me to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession to public <unk> and that is that I live with <unk>
I love to find, and I was rather recently, photographing and publish on my blog suits.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is <unk> <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I'm going to meet people who are passionate about, usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
I would like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we were doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings it to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly one week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after coming here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
So as I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that <unk> or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you tell you about the right people, you don't just tell you, you also love you."
<unk> <unk> of the boy who carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remember their <unk> <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you know, there's no look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth -- six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and only it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and again when people came up with this week, just so I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
This is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> because at the end of the corner, there will always be another suit and colorful colorful and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part -- and the right side, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So, where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
Can you be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need pretty much logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them playing with them and then we see how they react. And then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You can have developed a intuition that you may have developed over the years is the one that says one thing can be just in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing a parking bar.
It was a little kid, and I didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that parking lot showed him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particles, because they don't play with parking bars, play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
At that point, the physics was a few years ago; you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects that are around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit my logical part.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't be on the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why he should.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on a quantum <unk>
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I am going to expand it a little bit. It's just right in the center.
And then here's a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, a <unk> way that stands up on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip -- again, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
And for the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum zone, but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up let it go up and do those things, because I don't want it to piss you, or actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The companions on the journey of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's also the light that you have, and the wind that goes on to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave from the quantum mechanics, we would have to go into all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we introduced a <unk> and pulled out the air, and pulled it up to a temperature of less than one degree per degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way that I was looking for, it was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> which is expanding and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth impulse, we could make it <unk> and that we don't take it at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
At the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, and why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of you.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about the quantum mechanics that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief who is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and so on.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they would do it with 17 very interesting museums.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining simply in this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I didn't get rid of a great education -- I don't know myself, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and art artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than a demo of a demo and then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all of the museums there.
There's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You're going to move around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click of the top, we jumped inside.
They're inside, they want to go to the end of the hallway in the street.
Are you going to go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign of it.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured on what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 billion pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get to 10 billion pixels.
It can zoom in around very simple.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression is no price.
But if you really want to look at it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems to be <unk>
I walked in, and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I was a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is on hitting a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and deeper and you'll see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the picture, so you see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best is to come, one second.
So now we're going to quickly jump again to MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> play.
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk> I think I had never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online and create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just made a zooming in.
This is about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send them to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media makes justice to your artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that makes me nowadays is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think about it is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab we call it design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture in this picture -- I'm from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that has happened something very interesting in <unk> careers in the last two decades.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to earn a career of <unk> one, take a budget and drop it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made a career.
This is what in engineering, it will be <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're coming back to the open.
And as <unk> are beginning to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you see aside that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and even 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> in the weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms that are getting sensors and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that as humans have in the outside environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> said that at the end, he took the hammer -- and he threw it to the Moses -- -- you can still see a small dent in <unk> and he said <unk> <unk> in fact, <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of that.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end he made Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at the activity that happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the Athabasca River.
It's tomorrow, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the late evening there are people over here and making call called <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go into the toilet.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
That night everyone went to <unk>
There you see the big summit.
The next day, everyone was at the center of the winning team and the first minister of then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> not about people, but of things we use and we consume.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash on its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage -- and then we started <unk>
These are the results?
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that before not existed.
They're happening going on complicated things and there's lots of need.
But the other thing we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we beat is not simply somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we beat down a day still still still there.
That if we showed people, we can also be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology be, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop -- was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> that open up and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with water.
If you fall the pixels you can write on them, show patterns, images texts.
And we zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
It liked a lot.
And <unk> a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows, but when you come up up to it it opens up for you to happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture is just simply like this case.
Those days, there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but that when it's low almost all of the architecture goes away.
Here it is running.
You see the people who are looking at what happens in the inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when you test the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun to do.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that kept making breaks and holes, and you had to jump up to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs.
But then the reality is <unk>
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is an image of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud, we could form this cloud, right?
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what changes is light, not the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then that then all of that would be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can zoom in and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like it before.
When the light, you see the light, the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them <unk> by one person.
We can have each pixel with an entrance to come from people, from the movement, of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dance <unk> today, the star of the New York City and <unk> star to capture its 3D movements and use it as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time motion capture.
It can make the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and the <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We have digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is, we can go from the digital world -- the power of the networks, the power of the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in the collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered from pixels.
You can move inside, you have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new summit of London.
You can go there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than you are.
Suppose I told you that, with only about changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more accurate, the more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better shape, it will be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure from themselves?
What about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do you understand creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many do you want memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about the <unk>
Oh, the majority. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of the world that would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you the eye of a doctor on the subject.
The great glimpse of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church, <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing <unk> makes sense of the light of the <unk>
But if they actually accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this galaxy, right on one end, is, of course, the most interest we care about.
<unk> of common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here today <unk>
It might seem that we are far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
They realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is chemically <unk> of which comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the most bacteria gut than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> makes them raises the <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm -- dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that they can want without their <unk>
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with occasional disruption in some rush rush to <unk>
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential to our life.
They help digest nutrient nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We are in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something probably better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk -- so I hope you've got it.
When I was just attending college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental about most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms in each cell simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two new cells.
But when organisms show up, things start to change.
It goes into the sex reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that goes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the death toll of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death in <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I was to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it, he finds a magnificent dancer from clothes.
He looks at it and he goes, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"It's fine. He says, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more more healthy.
Evolution is about changing the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are sort of <unk> rockets that are designed to send the genetic load to the next level level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think that all of the <unk> the feeling that put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to do immortality through my work.
I want to give you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily inspire longevity.
It doesn't necessarily hurt the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the most clever.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive to the heat of the <unk> that we would argue, if there were fish there, fish pumps into a vacuum -- yet they've managed to do that an alien environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look at what is happening in evolution and if we look at the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to <unk> <unk> I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the thought of reasoning behind it would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we have <unk> and we get rid of so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation of evolution.
A second possibility is that you have a evolution of the kind of natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of the evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the species -- when species, as distant planets are going to exist and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility -- one possibility democracy, intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but is what you choose at the individual and the family level.
Just think that if it could be possible to choose not just sex from your <unk> but in its own body to make genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 for 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of close to 20,000 and in a week.
Not to be a lot of money to make the human genome per capita and be increasingly at the reach of all.
They come those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against the flu flu -- in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then just two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate your diabetes, eliminate cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of comparing this to next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can apply it to 1,000 years and maybe occur in the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these options in <unk> for a better society, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust, and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what it might do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 3,000 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already taken the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot is called the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the <unk>
It <unk> the engines.
Imagine being in an airplane and without noise.
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was important. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to fold all the experiences that I have wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that, later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is when I was looking at the George Washington bridge that was not a lot -- I thought, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave a place to my ego.
And I'm feeling the time that I would take on things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then as <unk> at that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mental watch is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
Am I saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break up in 20 pieces and look at those <unk>
And while I was born, I had the feeling of, wow, it is not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for our whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is being bent in a single thought, which is, just a thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade -- not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for being in the world.
At that point, I understood by connecting those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For most of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was given a miracle, not dying that day.
And I was given another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and to live differently.
You are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and for whatever -- but you can imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that you still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the biggest <unk> in the '80s.
One day he got her home after he run, and he said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> today has total paralysis in it.
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design design and animation, and so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and his father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "All I want to talk about Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all the people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody else and you have a sure you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie <unk> <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way, they are making it with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check and instead he signed a check that he had no idea how he was going to <unk>
And I joined his brother and his father there at the moment, right now, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it is ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner can't make it happen.
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research Research -- which has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer drawn on that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things about one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that they could <unk> could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get a email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the world's <unk> world to our home.
My wife, kids and I, moved to the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and when he <unk> they would have taken away the frames of the walls and their place would be <unk>
But for two weeks, <unk> we went to the <unk> <unk> and my son was part, my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk>
These are a couple of sunglasses that we bought in the <unk> <unk> <unk> some copper wire and things from Home <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on an LED light, and there's now a device that's free -- and we publish the code -- we publish the software that is low in a <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say <unk>
There's no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we returned to the <unk> room.
I love this photo because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year planning, two weeks of reading science sessions from all night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran out the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
And the funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were looking at graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time that I was in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
Isn't that <unk>
It's kind of our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion and developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a quantum <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
And so we're trying to figure out how to move it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've gained lots of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the center of Los Angeles, there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> in urban urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is quite awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something and I would have wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not right now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations often very difficult and at the same time a little dangerous time.
I went to the <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days of eating just this -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in large part of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance situations with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that <unk> <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing it interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you see fun, affordable for the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and a partnership wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following: I mean, <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it's all about and as content in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But that is a very good chance to be able to be able to be <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would have had no time <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked the world of marketing on advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've gotten in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could do it for something so difficult or so dangerous to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about <unk> and marketing and advertising, and that the <unk> and the <unk> and that all the film will come up with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The biggest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The biggest movie ever <unk> is that all of the top to the bottom of the end, has a brand images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes up before the title of the title, <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is what? <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure of cutting all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and you get the biggest shoe you ever had.
The biggest car that you've driven in "The biggest <unk> that you've been running <unk> of "The largest <unk> <unk> <unk> movie.
<unk> <unk> The idea is in addition to showing the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> making the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all the film, beginning to end.
And I would love to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it is the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
I don't know how responsive it is going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you look at it, it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it do to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for them to go to them, but it's definitely going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands in a couple of steps.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment when the movie comes out, we look at it as a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What is it going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: Two things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to do it.
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the media stage and the separate media scenario -- it's not the idea to tell that new vehicle that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been good.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which are characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices -- the last line is perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the <unk> even the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it's trying to make it reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, the transparency day <unk>  like that weird bear that still continues to have.
It's <unk>   Like this weird road path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was lying to me in some lie -- and he's staring at him as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there is the realism <unk>
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take you out the <unk> and go to companies I would have to go to companies myself.
So what I started to figure out all of a sudden -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge, giant films and others who make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who make great Hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful is because the marks associated with that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with somebody else to say "Are you fine for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> from the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man like <unk> strong, <unk> on bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen <unk> We're a little brand <unk>
<unk> the kind of movies that we were born, we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, you remember giving people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
KF: That's a big question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something new, cool.
I think that <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps it cool.
How do we keep them cool longer? With better <unk> more <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a startup company.
What about me? What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, they say, <unk> unless it comes to <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, lots of gray colors, lots of gray things.
I usually wear it as the sun sunglasses, or I like the <unk> and the similar <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: You know, <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the type of pets.
We would call toys to pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that is my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: Go!
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand Tom, but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> out of that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you are looking at, like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case come from, and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about ...
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way of going to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like things weird stuff.
A: <unk> from <unk> to what does that do for us?
What's the <unk> What phase is, what phase you encounter now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Let's get a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> A: Yeah. <unk> Thank you very much.)
MS: Yes, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was really serious about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality of <unk> Morgan Morgan -- it's a <unk> brand.
They got very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are only going to focus on one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be able to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements and you actually get <unk> and you make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is classical <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and marks, those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is something pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to <unk> your identity <unk> your personality personality -- what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you rather an attribute <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as a <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or bold <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystical <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
You're conscious as <unk>
Are you traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, sacred, sacred or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of the desire in the brain as much for movie marketing like film.
We went to San Paulo where they've been forbidden the ad into the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And then we went to school districts in which companies are getting their way into the schools with money problems in America.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I have had the biggest response or where I've had the success I've ever had to do with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took off their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? they should succeed?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
The film was early in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we have had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just about a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even done in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this movie has already begun to earn momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we're talking about is telling their customers not to be part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks there is opportunities.
I think when you take the people out of that that's pushing it to failure.
I believe that when you train their employees in loss aversion is preparing your entire company to make them <unk>
I feel that what is going to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can get.
Ultimately, then I think we have to give it a place to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is, <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today, more than ever honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk, <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> large data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: And then June <unk> on behalf of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to name from the TED matrix of TED, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for the next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest active to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems control systems.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software <unk> they are completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows on a portable computer that was used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray box hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
Is it easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started researching <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> these <unk>
That struck us attention, and we started an experiment in which we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they got very strange things.
<unk> <unk> as a <unk> rat who didn't like our <unk> the <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after I experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box, if you find a specific configuration -- and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place:
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we would take the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were all the points to attack.
And you probably even know how much to look at the operator.
So you know it.
And if you heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, high-tech, technology, let me tell you, the load is very complex.
It's very far above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning, they were calls in the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to connect them with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants.
I called them and I asked them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to be able to slow down and <unk> in one obvious effort to go <unk> to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the <unk> number is <unk> in that code, you can't get it.
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
So it's not just like this.
The results have been from behind a few weeks of hard work.
We were going to fly out of dead ends.
Even so, we discovered that both of both digital <unk> meant to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about the other goals to be <unk> by <unk>
So here are some very interesting things that we just saw, I really would get off.
There's the gray box and up the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values for example sensors and sensor sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false <unk>
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security chamber.
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine is happening, you have to open up to open vacuum valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, of course.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they are <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither of the <unk> no security system would be.
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, specifically, with <unk> with <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or a car factory ...
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> <unk> that disseminate this payload with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology <unk>
It <unk> as possible.
And if you look at that, with what we're going to do, is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such heart attacks are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces in a large number of goals.
We need to face the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.
<unk> has become public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower superpower here.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in a way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that you can take away and give them <unk> or another one that makes users of wheels -- raise them and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
There are nothing different than something that is put in the morning, gives you a great force, which is also increasing its speed, and helps it to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only does that -- it can integrate it and connect to the universe and with other remarkable things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, he has to take on their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage of my back.
So we decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton exoskeleton -- I can put it up to 90 pounds of variables over many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to get into <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back and look at the users of the wheels, what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million of people roughly, in the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very often, people who have damage to the spinal cord than we would start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that gets <unk> quickly.
Their only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- it's the wheelchair.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
So let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was <unk> in the <unk> column, and as a result couldn't come back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
So Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
Does it have some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that they send signals to on board, here on the back.
There's also some batteries that give power to the motors on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it forward with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing up it costs <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost a lot of feeling and all moving <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never coming to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole myself to the last ounce of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even mount <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of <unk> to all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet his cousins.
This is the world of <unk> <unk> of forests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives, their closest lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've gotten too emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where violent violence hasn't ever observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been lasting for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put in danger to the survival of the Bonobo.
The meat of hunting meat and deforestation is made that you can't fill a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and, honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know we know it like apes <unk> the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us, and for them, the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter, the dance and the ritual in humans.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball game, and I don't speak football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> he has <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case, he loves him, right?
Yes.
So sexual play is both both in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows you the invention of bringing <unk> elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female -- which is playing with <unk> water.
I think that we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to success to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> the most of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate to play, they can be the moments in which it is the most urgent ones.
And so fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as you will, creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City, I'm responsible for the development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a city of <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers will lead to a highly skilled private staff you have to reach the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so he had a pretty high probability of going.
But still, there was a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain and find out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, and she was standing outside of the rain, she was standing outside of the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I had before, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- he got to the captain and he asked her to go into the dog and he asked her to the dog's dog's dog.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a building in flames to save a live living because he won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need it to the house.
I need the fire <unk> and it brings this woman a couple of <unk>
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the fire firemen -- that at that height or less had been finished off the fire and went to the fourth grade for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back to the ladder where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog at the front door.
He ran out of the house the treasures for home where, as he would expect, his trove trove more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort shown to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that somebody had reached him even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as my calling as a voluntary fireman is witnessing the acts of generosity and kindness at a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage at the individual.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made or are by having -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: I don't know.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something for giving, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back. Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan, big <unk>
The first concrete block was built in <unk> with a very simple idea, of cement in cement in a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called the <unk> brick
And in a few years, the <unk> brick were all home.
It's estimated that you've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings, or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to take the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there is a difference. The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that it is bound by magnets.
So you can't put it wrong in the wrong way.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the stream, the pink is the stream, the pink is the entrance and the orange color.
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly you can start to make major circuits.
A blue with a green make light.
We can put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a module module that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slower, I'll just turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to be attached to bricks to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to the kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works works or why the door of an elevator stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We have also led to design schools.
So for example, the designers without any electronic experience started playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> -- a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the School of Rhode Island School of Island <unk> who don't have any physical experience, just in cardboard, and paper and we said, "Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> <unk> activated activated show.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> it became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach out of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interaction world is us.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for the focus on the focus on the developing environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
Can you take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm going to be at the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be, we asked them to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like <unk> <unk>
We took some members every year, and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with the employees of <unk>
Their task is about showing the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant in Boston.
Here it looks like I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is someone else to clean it out of the snow because he knows that it's not very good at turning out fires when it's covered for a meter of snow.
How did he ask for help in this <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we had a lot of last year.
They realized that the city will never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
Is it a nice app that you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put it a name, in this case, you put it up.
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a peer component of it.
It's a modest application.
It's probably the smallest of 21 applications -- last year.
But does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
It spreads <unk>
A responsible for systems of the city of <unk> to see this app realized that it could use it not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important that these <unk> of tsunami, but people have <unk>
That's why he asks the citizens the <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just took me to get people to sit down to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan using it.
And this has spread out of <unk> organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen yet.
<unk> acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then we were told to have done by the normal channels would have taken at least two and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the power court of California that far has cost 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of <unk> warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the better government ways to work, not as private companies as many people think that it should be.
It's also not like a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
That is, without <unk> in the way and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way we address the issue of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution -- but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications -- every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
They feel a big frustration at that, but they didn't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that you get nuts, the government is essentially in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because he alone doesn't exist.
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government in the last instance grows of us -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of telephone care and information center.
It's the place that calls calls if you brand 311 on the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> in the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find any. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put it very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well along Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no telephone center.
It's got a <unk> and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
We don't think of that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York, <unk> in Boston.
And one day, this really comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to civic collaboration with <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean by the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to engage and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And it might have connected with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper and cheaper to the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that's a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our entry to the government system is a vote.
How many times have they chosen a political <unk> Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that government <unk> our values and make sense of our needs, but we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what keeps us from that we had to have based on something that we could operate in our own, that something else, and a consequence we're losing the power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of <unk> <unk> pages in response to the request of the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> us before the government, it's time to ask, what world do we want to leave with our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We cannot leave with government, we need to be more effective.
So the good news is that with technology is possible to be able to rethink the root function of the government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I -- to <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that nearly granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to speak, everybody will talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when the government problem doesn't care about making their voices heard.
They're using your hands.
They lay into the work to program applications that make better government work.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> out of it, dumping a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to get these fire hydrants and lots of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not just consumers, not only are we not just consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of the present, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, will be a crowd of voices, or also we will be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has an identity.
And the things that are saying here has impact on the whole world.
So sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think that we have learned that the words of a teacher may have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She took a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in Virginia in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery was the way the world looked like.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at it, she came up and gave me a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe, and then I got <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back and say, <unk> I still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I was going to tell me about again, and if I told him I know, yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture his time and her attention.
My cousins were running around.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at it, and I was like, but she was really serious.
And after 15 or 20 minutes, she got up and walked across the room, he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I don't know him, I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked down, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do it."
I will never forget.
Then he said, "Just do I want me to make me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell you, is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do that."
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell you, is that you're always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I was like, "Yes, <unk> So I'm going to do."
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell you, is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do that."
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a brother a year older and a younger sister.
When I was 14 or 15, one day, my brother came home with a six beers, and I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, and you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well. Take a <unk>
I said, "No. I didn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And he went on with the force with the force and the <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who really don't make sense of it.
We can't get them to do things that they don't think to do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that we had to do with it, we had <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people on parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it is so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is in prison or parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, County, Baltimore Washington -- 50 to 60 to 60 percent of all young people in the prison or the parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better and guilty, which if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results of the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems with us.
We're <unk>
I find interesting.
We're looking at our work in some very good developments in <unk>
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you might give you any rights <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black men has lost completely the right to vote.
And if we showed it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before it was before it was before you get the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where it is sentence to 18 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for kids, without a chance of coming out.
Now we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They went to people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense they've been asking us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not trying to decide whether people deserve to die for effective crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
death penalty is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine people who was <unk> has identified that it's innocent which is <unk> and liberated from death row.
One rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent in every B.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't be allowed to never fly airplanes if every nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about history <unk> I talk about slavery to me.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know much about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a defined of terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what he defined his lives.
There are now older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, makes people stop saying that in our history we deal with about terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time I was going to share with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs me work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the <unk> of race without a compromise with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving the talks about death.
And it was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know, it's good worrying about listening to what you want.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can never be able to have it here."
The room stood in silence and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we could never have to get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational than us, <unk> and <unk> would put us <unk>
I think about this.
How do we engage in a world where a nation like Germany, contributed to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not believe it.
It would be irrational.
And still, this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology <unk>
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
Recently we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more engagement with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that is going to be more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in some ways, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so deeply motivated with the intellectual <unk>
The innovation, with creativity. The development is not only about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas from <unk> also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just bright and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, guidance for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think still in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity, than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, as I was a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to talk.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> called me to go, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> We're going to get together to talk.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion he was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. <unk> came to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me what is that idea of justice <unk>
They are trying to do what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We tried to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We tried to end up with the prayer sentences without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population on prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and I just looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> out very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> got his finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated at simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is superior to the worse than we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, by our designs, not our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich and <unk> but as they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound questions about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been trained with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> <unk> and 14 years that have been <unk> to be trained as adults as adults.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody who is not it?
The judge was being sold as an adult, but I see a child.
One night very late I was wake up <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't have, must have clear powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has legal powers.
You should ask for something of that.
As I was so late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my 14-year-old black client is treated as a privileged <unk> executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there have been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical and a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or the <unk>
For my horror, not only the <unk> he had sent it to the court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And then finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down the car. It went to the court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> it was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you?" I said yes.
And then I approached my <unk>
And I was staring at me in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That is deeply connected in my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we started going.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy things.
They got the policemen by <unk> <unk> <unk>
And suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people -- everywhere because we are talking about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I reached the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and let me hear all that <unk>
It will be walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black <unk> with a concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> showed up because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk>
And the old white man stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this audience room, to tell this young woman who would keep his view in the target with <unk>
I have come to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human beings -- if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to the other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity and creativity must <unk> the <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Make sure to hear and see an obvious desire in the audience, of this community, to help in your own words, to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There's several times close opportunities there.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to give us the funds that are being spent today.
For example, here in California, they're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death, in the next five years a billion dollars.
And even though this, the <unk> of the cases of homicide are not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get anywhere.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to make the rule of law, to safety.
I think there's a very strong opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think that is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass mass in this country is not crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric for punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to supply chain to rob a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Wow. Have you excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much because you've come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be from the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our own day, our senses are getting many, many more data than probably the brain can get.
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So from a <unk> of <unk> stories to look at the negative ones.
That old saying of <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news. seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be bad in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe what really happens is that we get <unk>
Perhaps huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create an abundance world in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: <unk> the climate change, the scarcity of species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubts them.
As human beings, we are very good at making the problems and, in the long, we just ended up with them.
Let's take the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita adjusted for inflation in the whole world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food and the power of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy was 25 to over 80 to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people get it.
And we keep <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined meaning from poverty.
<unk> today in America, most of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water toilets, <unk> mobile phone, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of <unk>
And so much of this is technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that I read in technology technology jumps down this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price of price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that has in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad days -- in the war and peace, in recession in <unk> and <unk>
It's the resulting end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law to the left, the curve is going up.
The growth rate of technology is in more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
<unk> in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call infinite computing computing, sensors and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and form personalized biology, all over the planet -- synthetic biology, fuel and food, digital medicine, <unk> and digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory of Watson, <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this:
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of your cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year, we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would be <unk> absurd.
We can actually point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create life <unk> for every single <unk> is about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He is the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with silver, and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum covered with aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
This is why the tip of <unk> to Washington is of aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
And we had this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we used in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about budgets, but it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have water abundance as well.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager space to the Earth, in 1990, after it passed <unk>
And a famous photo <unk> How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is seawater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's an available technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to give me their technology called <unk> <unk> -- already the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator one.
It's able to generate 1,000 liters of water drinking water from any single source -- seawater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought that it will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes right, and I have full confidence that I will be, Coca-Cola will implement it the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an extraordinary innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it on cell phones.
My God, we're going to get 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile tools in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan take 25 years ago.
And if you have a smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have happened.
Now, better than that, and the things that you and I have paid them tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video and music and music technology -- <unk> technology -- and they are now <unk> and lost market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to do when it is a difference in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce to the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the equipment in the world to make these technologies into a mobile device that they speak, and because it has <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certified team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the load burden is 25 and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't understand, to call the health <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion growing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just spent the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion of the Internet users.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add up to global conversation.
What would these people?
What would you do? What would you <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the biggest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education at the Khan Academy for the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions in 3D and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
What about some voices never had before <unk>
What if we give them to the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and we can act for the first time?
What do you do?
And if they are contributions we can't afford to.
Something that I learned with the X Prize, is that small, guided by his passion with a clear goal, they can do things that were <unk> things that before they could only make the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end with sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, I was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and began <unk>
And it has shown that today the basic pattern recognition machinery is better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovator <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds, new minds that are encouraged to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few decades for extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that I had no longer like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
He caught a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red List from the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, over the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibit to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> about 20 feet -- the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he was getting more than average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down in half.
I went to five centimeters.
It will be an genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a sense, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose to the countries that were already 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this boat, pretty bad -- called <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in southern China in China -- and above all, in the Aral Sea.
So what we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are tiny blobs about the <unk> remains that are fish coral reefs.
In short, the sea floor came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The bottom line is going to be a soft fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains that they collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there is no documented.
We <unk> the world, but we don't remember.
I would take the starting point of starting a new level, not remember what was there.
If you look at it something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation use the images to be inspired by the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing, and I extrapolate forward.
The difference is that you perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end of the <unk> remains.
And that is a big thing, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they did anymore.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose wild animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because evidence presented in a previous way that they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the present, as I have to have a captain such and so I looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used, or usually they don't use the scientists of <unk> because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Hence the enormous role that can come a protected area.
Because the marine zones -- we actually visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run over, and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area, and they can benefit from the vision that we want, which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people of the Middle <unk> for example?
I think that the arts and cinema can maybe fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were being touched by the film, talking about the story of <unk> why do you deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is to <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> a <unk> manager manager to look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today we will see why the videos are doing viral and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be asked on the Internet in a <unk>
You go over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, only one little percentage of the other percentage is viral and he gets lots of visits and wins in cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> communities of participation communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God, my God.
Oh my God.
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of popularity last summer.
<unk> you couldn't do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if you call <unk> Mountain <unk>
It had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this thread to <unk> video to popularity video.
The trends as Jimmy <unk> are presented with new things and interesting things and <unk> into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>
<unk> of Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have arisen from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, I was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also on Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, he took her <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But what's important is that a person or a group of trends will embrace a point of view, and share it with a wider audience, the process.
So this community of people who share this big joke -- then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way of being part of the SUV phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a repetitive animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that it's rare, you know that there is a <unk> version that has seen four million times.
So far the cats saw this video.
And there are cats to see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made one version of the ancient version.
And then he made international act.
Suddenly it arose a whole community of remixes that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca or Black "I <unk>
What script might have written this situation?
In a world that you go up two days of video per minute, just that really unique and unexpected can get rid of the way these things have done.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this big video of a guy who was <unk> against <unk> <unk> in New York City, I admit, I wasn't interested in it.
Casey <unk> So I was going to go wrong by <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you wrong with the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million of you saw and understand your idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we do in a creative way.
And this leads to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators who are creative and creative communities are absolutely unexpected, are features of a new type of media, in a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the media that are just the current media characteristics are the current media, but <unk> the future entertainment.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom in his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally <unk>
The words, for so much time is my <unk>
It <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He is my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not going to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
And the next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> turning into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to be a task called the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat is slid into the ocean Sea of metropolitan ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the limbs and the rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother was wearing an <unk> with poison.
If we were asked first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the motor, the <unk> and it will diving into each <unk> and the vast vast and vacuum.
I don't remember pirates who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of the men in our boat, or the motor dying and not being able to <unk> for six hours.
But I remember the lights out of the platform outside the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I tried to, given by the <unk>
No apple had later the same thing.
Then after three months in a refugee camp, we went into <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the <unk> in the middle class of middle class, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells of the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double the turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in I.T. I.T. <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> that was always <unk>
Two pairs of average for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> were going back to house."
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would tell us about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered from all the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> boys and men caught up between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were <unk>
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student with what I would think of myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> often, <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer elected the young Australian young of the year.
And I was <unk> out of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges don't <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and white, invited to talk to sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence she'd never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the habits, and the comfort of life in a suburb -- <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters just end up the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> he said, <unk> don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly, I was talking about, the more it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the paths of life, a lot of them doing what they would do, living on the border of the possible.
And even though I finished my research, I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
There was there to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, just a new come in the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my happy comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> <unk>
There was a energy there, an optimism <unk> a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for whom the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant pot pot that all of us have.
<unk> far at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before I end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused an <unk> to the <unk> and taking the cause herself itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't be <unk> to be wrong.
He was in the shower in the room in the hotel room when she went to <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and watched him stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell them stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked her to say, "Why is his hand <unk> and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from <unk> he said.
"You haven't <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because we were and how life <unk> we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would be easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want to look forward to it?
But I'm afraid of the privilege of what's easy, though.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, diving up with each other, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and drop the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
So at that time when we published the great prince -- ancient Indian warrior -- I was <unk> he took a bow and with a <unk> on the floor, he got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was really excited about that.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic, I don't know.
As a child my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technological <unk> was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world filled with <unk> images, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
We give our inspiration.
And so I was <unk> I was left to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad. I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
We put the text with the picture, animation and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do for us?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on your light."
And this is --  says, "This box belongs -- I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live alive because of GPS -- which comes to me.
My inner girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but that magic magic is to those ideas that <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release firefly fireflies.
And really, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
And another idea that I was fascinated by as a child was that a whole galaxy was in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I <unk> into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In the whole textbook there has always been maps but have been electronic maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and you guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another extraordinarily important aspect of me is to create Indian content and contemporary and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in today's cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing we're bringing them back into a children's history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that the kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this ritual ritual you have to go out and, in one chapter, you have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then take it out.
This is how a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are a lot of possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and the video on and through this video <unk> and you actually see a group of cartoons that appear about the inside plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves on the screen.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are linked with technology and magic and technology come to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop hearing patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University University, was a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of all, or perhaps not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail because we stop listening.
This is my <unk> Wi-Fi is a very simple thing.
It's got a doorknob of on and <unk>
Every morning I was hooked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
And I got the challenge to get to 95 percent of it.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my family problem is, not at the same time that I need assistance assistance or some urgency of that style -- but he would go to the back.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than four Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my <unk> <unk> and before I got to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move the people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available in the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would go from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, turn back to recover control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care for health because of the challenges we face, as the firing care costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video video.
We all have controls of shipping in <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM ATMs are <unk>
Where are you all <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the <unk> closest to help this patient?
We asked ourselves, but no one did it.
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
So what we did was we made the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please look at them -- where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and other they're closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to search for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> they can use their iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their <unk> cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to go to the global level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at another universities, so that we will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us experience these <unk>
You could be messaging services or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in place.
Please <unk> on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here for sharing <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my earlier passion by drawing it, but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you pull the <unk>
For me, photography was more than to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It looked like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
And they were going to look like this is a building on a very steep road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful enough, but with the common objective of keeping the performance level.
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want you to be captured in some way as a photograph.
It will be in which you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it happen.
It's the details or the <unk>
Do you get the light?
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is our perspective.
But in the end, it comes to our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a slippery surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but of what we think is realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
So here we have three objects perfectly <unk> something that we can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if we were there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's go into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining pictures.
It really does combine different realities.
And the things that make a photo look realistic as realistic as I think they're those in which we don't even think of the things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs is very important because otherwise something is wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos have <unk> you have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and end of different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that you would find out because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, even what I did is the house of the top of the island of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome I think is that we need planning.
It always starts with an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and it's very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a folder of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing on the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area.
And what's interesting about this is that this one, as many other people we tend to see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here something happens.
And that's what I'm just going to talk about.
Please turn out the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why would we have the technology <unk> <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve that, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any kind of the technology that I would like to suggest -- the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look at example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the <unk> technology technology is as fast as the <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be Tokyo in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that beating.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development, which every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these <unk> curves. We see that they're not forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical <unk> I know like this until something totally different, or maybe it will do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
And so now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, is, what is that new way that <unk> the world?
What new state is running the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we are engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference that people talk about the future, and we see the future remains 2000.
That's what we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
We can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't make much sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that I can extrapolate what we're doing today has no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to be <unk>
But to do that have to have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we looked at each billion years.
So you go back a couple of two and a half thousand years ago when the Earth was a big sterile rock, with many different chemicals that are coming around it.
If we look at the way that these chemicals were born, we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was a few <unk> oil with all sorts of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those drops of oil <unk> held a particular combination of chemicals that made them build materials from the outside and so <unk> grew up grew up grew up with.
And they started <unk>
In a certain sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you have <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that we have.
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow become better at the time to incorporate chemicals. They grew more than more chemists and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemistry -- very simple, but things become interesting when these droplets learned the <unk> trick.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution <unk> a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to get.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world, and it's here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it on a virus and have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happily be happily another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things got very different, and it was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information into the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So, for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin, and they were <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that in a way, they were put together in it, and set a <unk>
That <unk> or <unk> <unk> or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community would become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came up with so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the prescription from the community to a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities coming out of many kinds of different cells working together as one organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve the heart of the heart, or the muscles in the brain, or so on.
So these communities evolved and produced levels of interesting levels than cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level that happened in these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they weren't doing more than processing information in community.
These are the structures.
The neurons are the devices that we process the information that those cell phone communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures and understand and transmit the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not at the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communication trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea an idea in your head.
I'm sitting here emitting a couple of <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> on your heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
Now we go through periods of similar periods of organisms -- we have our control methods and our record methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer is the <unk> the <unk> and so on, it's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which some evolution with the program <unk> in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years of each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next on, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I get my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer events.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to think about conventional ways.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions of millions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about the abstraction, we put it in the machine, and we put it into the machine and the machine that does something that before you did, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions on chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all these programs, and take those that more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tidy numbers, just to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to set up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely to take a random sequences.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the order of the order of it.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
<unk> those and <unk> to the rest.
And now we need the best to do the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following an analog process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the children will take the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
I put some mutations in.
And it tries to try and try again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases in a few hours.
At the end of the end, we ended up with programs that are <unk> <unk>
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
And I've tried to figure out how to see how they work.
These are dark programs.
But they do this <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of getting the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
Once he was on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he picks up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> a plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer <unk> you can't feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
But we don't understand all the choices that there is.
It goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that they can run these programs very quickly.
I mean, it is <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what's going to come.
But now I'm lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I got <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for letting me give a part of my fake <unk>
Before I deal with my talk, we talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you heard it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that would take over.
That means that the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who tries to <unk> the first base doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three of 10.
You know what they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk> of <unk>
By the way, that is someone that 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of the League of the League of <unk> in the running smallest <unk> <unk>
Now I think this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or perhaps less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon who has also an record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place, and a wanted to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family member will bring it to a cardiologist whose record is 200 percent.
But do you know what?
She's getting better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask them.
What do you think you have to be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a <unk> of a nurse or a <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, from a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is <unk> to the world, and I was included, with the <unk> of being perfect.
You would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was talking about when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a partner in high school said that Brian Sachs was a <unk> to a blood test.
Is it which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the front residence of General Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of <unk> <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> labor <unk> and not standard.
And I even knew a differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were to make it all, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here in Toronto, when they brought to the lady <unk> in the emergency room where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was able to address a cardiologist I was able to attend to the patient.
And I report to the chief of detail.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I heard it, I heard a <unk> sound on both the side, what sent me an heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of pump your blood forward, blood goes to your lungs, they fill in blood, and that's why there's a difficulty of it.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I was <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of detail.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my head would have seen, I would have been able to bring information to it.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
By sending her home, I didn't notice a voice in my inner voice that said, <unk> is not a good idea. We don't know it.
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse to <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think being right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so he signed the high and the ambulance along with the <unk> they brought her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I went out to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. At that time I did something I don't do normally, I didn't do it.
I went through the emergency room on the emergency way.
And there is another nurse, not the one that <unk> from the lady <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors were <unk>
Other specialists as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with complete <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same <unk>
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
After an hour of having reached her home, after I gave him the high, he suffered and his family suffered and his family called the <unk> the <unk> brought in the emergency room of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock severe.
I would just just breathe and I was blue.
The emergency staff are all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> until the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and waiting for all hope to be <unk>
And in the two or three days of course it was clear that he never <unk>
He had permanent <unk> damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they went out to what was going on.
And the ninth day, they let him go. <unk> wife, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks later, I was looking at it and experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and sat by himself, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't relate to your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is the that makes us feel very bad inside.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't my <unk> he was a <unk>
I spoke to the family and I'm sure I would get things and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept doing those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did I send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little to little that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, he was opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if we were going to take the efforts to be perfect so that you don't get more errors, I would do those voices anyway.
And he did.
I went back to work.
But it was going to happen.
Two years later, I was appointed the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him up penicillin and sent him home.
But while he ran to the door he kept her <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my boss asked to speak with me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: Do you remember you?
Do you remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
And he went back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google -- it's an infection, not from the throat, but the upper level -- and that it may cause the close to those tracks.
He, to him, luckily, not <unk>
<unk> antibiotics and antibiotics and <unk> in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times at the same turn of the <unk> <unk> not <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out, a colleague who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the lower bottom, and called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I ordered the liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to do it.
I looked at it and when I noticed some sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, called a surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well as well.
But every single case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful for the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't come up and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> which tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show this for them to not make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the errors of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust me that I would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It is the system where there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and what you can't sleep and you know that they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as you start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if we do not do our medicine to people who make mistakes.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and journalism, I've done a personal study of <unk> medical training, and medical errors to learn how possible the first article I wrote for the Toronto <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked on a system where mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are going to be wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where bacterial infections are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 <unk> by medical errors in this country.
The U.S. U.S. Institute set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't care about.
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in my chest, come up with <unk> eyes and I get breath out of alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always in the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the professionals who are likely to be likely to be familiar -- well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art, it's already a habit of saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> this is my worst <unk> blah blah, "What are you your <unk>
And their students were <unk> <unk> <unk> head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, I didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, the human tastes human, they accept it, and not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
It will share their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the errors of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everybody to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, you make mistakes at once in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently I did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that said to pick an average American -- it's about 70 to day.
Not a lot, in a research followed by a week to a group of trials of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks about these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do we do the way that we deal with those <unk>
So today, I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for you please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> supermarket very, very sophisticated at least at that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
And there were 250 different kinds of <unk> and <unk> over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, why I never buy nothing?
This is a shelf <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that come from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses filled with tourists that came every day, usually with your cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
aisle.
They had different kinds of different classes.
You put a place for <unk> just to the gate of the store.
We had <unk> <unk> or <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when he had <unk> a <unk> that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From the ones that stopped when there was <unk> only three percent got to buy <unk>
What stood up when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably give us less good enough to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the options <unk> is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to be not decide, even when this doesn't get us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for retirement for about a million Americans, from between about 650 plans from this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of labor offers available in savings plans for retirement, <unk> program <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two, until 59 options.
And what we found is that the bigger the number of hedge fund was less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as tall as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer a couple of 60 funding, the rate of participation went down to the 50th <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who they decided to participate, the greater the number of choices, more people will be infected by avoiding actions or hedge funds.
As soon as options, they were more willing to invest in financial reports.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we were talking about to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three key negative implications by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, the <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, health.
They're more likely to pick up less than <unk> although you objectively so much better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that gigantic range of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to <unk> contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today, I want to add you to four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is <unk>
They've already heard before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always bothered by when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of odd options, there's going to be an increase in sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When we <unk> & <unk> I went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When we Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for food -- which is less <unk> they grew up <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and cost costs.
The average case is known for today, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, you have about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce in tin.
In the world of financial savings, I think that one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is by David <unk> the Harvard show.
All employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to an insurance fund of life.
And those who really want to choose -- they provide them for 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All options are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want the <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. All right. All of you are ready to accept the deal.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the second one, but I can tell you, and say they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the problem of options that is <unk>
For people understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very concrete ways.
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average when they use credit or credit card than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> staff who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting is exactly how we were playing, we had a little <unk>
What we add was that we appeal to the staff who would think about the positive things they would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their bank accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway that I did.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> along the corridor of <unk> the magazine exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This framework is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something to <unk> not the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funds.
I suppose who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than what we think about if we just <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase complex complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very good decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allow them to <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, so you have to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go for many choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go in a few choices, four <unk> at 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to do?
What about you are.
If you <unk> always the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to young times, take the default button over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go in a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which the information arises.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although I pick the box of changes doesn't tell you anything about the preferences of decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So we can sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the urge for choices, <unk> to get rid of alternate alternatives -- <unk> doing it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to them were designed to help us drive the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for the people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices to be able to do the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s <unk> in East East Germany, <unk> if you had a writing machine I had to <unk> in front of the government.
It had to register a piece of text of example written with the machine.
And this for the government could trace the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much this is going to be able to do this, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody looks very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of them.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
This is Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys make their online loads, but they do it by illegal media by using banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret secret in the United States, two months ago, <unk> account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this counts had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most of the online crimes online.
The second group of suicide on importance today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate you, the protests, I do motivating <unk> you follow laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a major role in online attacks.
Those are the three bombers <unk> criminals who do it by money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group is the national states of the U.S.
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority from the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> the last fall due to a <unk>
Did you learn the security of the site and attack a <unk>
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with representatives of the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if we were to <unk> <unk> death of people to be <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk>
What do you do <unk>
Well, you need to do it if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority authority.
And they were able to make <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the protesters protesters -- the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and during the rise of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to <unk> a large scale the communications of citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 60,000 euros to the Nigerian government.
The company headquarters right here.
But the Western governments provide the tools to protect governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago I found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to research their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
It <unk> the connection to the Internet.
We even have tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see communication, and listen online to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems something wrong, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do that.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's on play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right, any right, that will be forever.
Are we going to blind in any future government, in an management that we could have over 50 years?
These are the questions that must worry about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in the southern Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions disappear, and this is what they do.
We loved our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we got up in the morning, and we found it dead -- I felt too bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up with the lions.
They were dying that they protect our community and the livestock and they are also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions they killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the Australian National Park.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would fear them.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it even was helping lions see the pen away.
I don't know me, <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that you move.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with which it will light up and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk>
It <unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load up the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights together.
As you can see, the <unk> give out, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see the lions when they come at night.
The lights were <unk> and they beat lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never became having trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed her many animals who were lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> can you see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've put them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving very much.
And my idea is also used for all of these Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used to be <unk>
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to one of the best Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community, and we built lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a boy in the meadows of the <unk> <unk> my father, and I used to see airplanes and I used to see it that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to reach out to be an engineer and a pilot when they grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other inventions electrical <unk>
What is the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close to electric CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know they already invented fences -- but I want to do my own.
CA: You know, I've heard it once, right? And I have tried -- I've tried it before, but I have tried before, but I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot, Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every single step that I had my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent the whole time studying the history of Kim <unk> <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except for America, South Korea, are the enemies.
Although I would sometimes ask me about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until it all changed a suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never starving.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we get to this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At some time, when I walked in front of the train, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in his arms looking at his arms face by his face without being able to do anything.
No one was <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine went to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequent energy cuts -- all around me was completely dark at night except by the lights in the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the countries.
This is the <unk> river which serves the North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> at certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined I would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as an Afghan refugee
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because Syrian refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate around North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police police and I was taken in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language and asked me many questions.
It was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I got to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the weather, one officer said to another, "This was a false <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking at <unk> <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and traveled to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to save many other Koreans haven't had so much lucky.
It's tragedy that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding jobs -- all their world can take place in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to risk by going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my pride in pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea wasn't that easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities, some of the money I sent to my family, and as blame my family was going to be displaced the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to get away immediately.
I began to plan how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and I went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to make it somehow over 3,000 kilometers across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and approached by a official police officer.
He asked you all of all the <unk> and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, he <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the border <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money for bribing the border guards, in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border of <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in <unk> capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in a <unk> in the embassy in South Korea.
I was going and came between the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But they didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asking, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary I gave him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM, and I gave me the rest of the money for my family and for two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I read it up with my whole heart, and I said, "Why would you <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, a new hope for me and for the people to get the people to come up with the <unk>
And I showed me that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the evidence that the people <unk> it needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice English practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with our family in contact with each other, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity for international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Korea in the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is Center -- <unk> stores of <unk> fast food, <unk>
So the city city planners came together, and they thought, let's change the South Pole to represent something else, so they changed it to L.A. and South America, as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A.  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, the Los Angeles Center, the home of food places to take and eat in the car.
What's curious about is that places for food to get killed more people than food in the car.
People are dying of diseases <unk> in Los Angeles South Pole.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I emphasize what this might happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of the house, you see the effects of the current food system in its <unk>
I see a <unk> <unk> and sold as <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I already got tired of driving 45 minutes away and back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
This is 45 <unk>
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to have it <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what come to me in wins, because it is my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our forest forest -- <unk> trees -- you know, nine vegetables <unk>
What we do, we are sort of a group <unk> <unk> made up by gardeners of all the <unk> all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city went on to me and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my own garden, <unk> became <unk>
And I said to me, "Come on.
A warrant for plant to plant food on a piece of land than no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's go away."
Because this time was not going to happen.
Times had the written story by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I even call to say that we were <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It's got 68 miles of land.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million plants.
Why on Earth do they not look good like this?
They took a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there. He <unk> my children there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the Earth can be done, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how does people affect people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became an educational tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the <unk> act and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
And I remember one time, who came up with a mother and her daughter was like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, salt and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people that I was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to rob your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I don't fear that you go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it up, but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put in a shelter in a shelter that was at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared their stories about how this had affected them, and how they used to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come, work and <unk> all of them in a volunteer.
If kids grow <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If they raise tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is being told if they're not taught how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat the blind to what you put in front of.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see guys on this path that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are getting away from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George <unk> <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block block where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't know me.
I'm not talking about it for free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to get people to get the kids out of the street, who know the joy and pride and honor to cultivate their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to do sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners are <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take them to take their <unk> right?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to look at me, you don't call me and you want to sit on the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk to you about doing some crap.
If you want to see me and come up with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably everybody will agree with me that this is a very <unk> road here.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days as today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water on the asphalt than you have.
And especially if you go on the stage on your bicycle and these cars go up, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material -- and if we built roads, like the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road to be.
The solution to that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has all pores and water can go through it, so all the water of rain will flow down the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water is never more.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very glamorous, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Watch that in this road rocks on the surface of the surface of the surface.
First, a stone, then several more and more and more and so on, and then -- and then then then -- you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
Oh. It's ready.
<unk> of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage comes into this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light -- the <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they're going to be <unk> and you separate from the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you take the <unk> you take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the wool of steel on little pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to make a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and rocks itself back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to warm the samples.
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we made a piece of road -- 400 feet away from the highway <unk> where we had to do a lane lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the car test, and then of course, this road lasts for several years without any damage, that's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, the first ones with our <unk> machine and the ones we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel, incorporating these fibers, using energy from <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface surface of the road, you can even double the surface of the surface. You actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before you can show them how repairability it does.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember aroused one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening by BBC News on his little gray radio.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news usually <unk>
The Taliban got to my father's father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> she told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and they made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I would love me as a kid to get my older sister to my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could make it <unk>
Every day, we were going to take a different route so that no one could suspect where you live."
We had to hide the books on market bags to look like we were shopping.
And the school was in a house over 100 of us who were <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that our life is the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban were <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to go?
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters were <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. It was in which his daughter, my mother, went to school and so his father would read it.
But my mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of all his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk not to educate their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember that there were times when I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you try to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want not to do it.
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school at <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home to educate his daughters, was one of the first <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> in my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I am driving it through the streets in Kabul.
My family thinks in me.
I dream a big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> by them, even though and still in front of a surgical opposition to it.
As <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed it's a father of one of my students.
Less than one month ago, he and his daughter went out from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When he got to his house, they are the phone -- a voice told him that if he kept sending her daughter to school, he would return to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I don't hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, it's often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
And that these changes would not last long, after the retirement of U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were looking for them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and a <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution broke out, inspired by the surge of <unk> massive <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and men who were young <unk> were at the U.N., <unk> each of the regime, <unk> freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a copy of knowing the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> of the East, to the West, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 dead war, we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, culture and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've treated along with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> an inclusive transition transition to democracy and national reconciliation,
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started to organize workshops about developing skills and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded women's <unk> <unk> <unk> -- a movement of women, leaders, short-term orientation leaders, which for the autonomy autonomy autonomy of the woman and our right of participation in participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that are <unk> of the selfish policies of domination, and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved, and successful.
The women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, was <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day we had the news of the murder of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack.
Another day we woke up with the news of official officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and the <unk> human rights human rights violations of prisoners and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, which is made up of an educational mindset, it will become more, and it has away from the ideals and early freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to talk about our history of the success of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the elections.
Rather, I'm here today to say, as a nation, we choose evil, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because election didn't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> and <unk> between candidate candidates and candidate peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination, and <unk> both for men like women.
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the election, that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the depiction of the feminine of the feminine is more than to need <unk> representation and <unk>
We need to stop acting as the outrage of outrage and call me days of anger.
We need to start acting like compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not only <unk> but also putting the mercy in practice, where collaboration is instead of a competition, which is inclusion in place of exclusion.
These are the ideals that such a Libya, needs desperately to reach the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that it involves all of the humanity that men and women, of which all tribes and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so just like the uterus is completely covering the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion caused all of existence.
This is how you say, "My mercy is going to look all around.
This is how you say, "My mercy is prevalent about my <unk>
That we all are given to you, the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a question that has an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody gets a long thing. Why do she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, and an expert at domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old at Harvard University.
I had moved me to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man who I create my alma mater, <unk> to the head with a <unk> loaded with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> it with <unk> more times than I remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap, who fall in love, where they fall every year of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the <unk> <unk> list between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been married almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence is happening to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in relationships and <unk> and long duration or said otherwise in the families, the last place where we wanted or to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse, is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to sit with a man who sticks, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women of 16 and 24 years old are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, rainy night in January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just taken away from a University of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most of the first meeting was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field <unk>
He had big <unk> like apples, and he had a hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was creating the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it all over the beginning of the beginning, in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, which I was ready, that he had gone to Harvard, who would put passion in helping girls <unk> and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And that's why the bachelor's at that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought that I had to make sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> left my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of a physical, financial and psychological and carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here is where those guns come in.
And as soon as I moved to New England you know, that place where you are supposed to be so safe to be so safe to buy three guns.
One guy had in the car.
Another he kept it below the pillow of our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in a small trauma.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never lifted up my hand, my life was really serious about danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical <unk> attack happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend brought out of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was confident that we were living happy for always, because I loved her, and he was also wanted to do that.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never make it harm.
I spent twice the moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong on the head that I would spend several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple days later, driving back from our <unk> moon, he went down and threw me a Big Mac Mac <unk>
<unk> continued to spend one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic or educational violence at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reported that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I was very good company.
So I'll go back to my question: Why do I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help us face their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do because we have the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the murder in domestic violence cases happen after the victim has put it to the relationship, after it <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to married, <unk> of financial resources, and it manipulation of family court court system to protect the victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges to spend time not to deal with the man who went to their mother.
And we still have wondering why they're simply not going to be going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> to beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody about the world to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family and full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you <unk> me.
We have the tendency to apply to the victims of the victims as <unk> women, <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people is a way to say <unk> is <unk> by <unk> like the <unk> victims of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a lesson from what happened to me and that they will embrace their lives joyful lives and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
And I went back to marry a <unk> guy, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to ever before, is a charged gun pointing to my head in somebody's hands that he tells me.
Right now, the same thing is thinking, <unk> -- that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid people <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they are <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting his daughter, her sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> of silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> require only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their friends, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
It will be <unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for about 10 years.
And I feel that right now there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like that.  Luckily, I brought me clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck from <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they don't have to do it now, but I'll figure out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater out of the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as it covers me.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a <unk> in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he would take the back and make her <unk> the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial <unk> like that I made a couple of days ago for work, there is very little that we can do it to transform our address, which, while superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a <unk> way.
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> -- but that doesn't mean nothing.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, over the last few centuries, we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> also the we've associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to take for money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> float along -- <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, you know, <unk> by knowing so much models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all of each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- is to say, less than four percent, not white ...
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be model when you <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know about that.
But then what I would tell you to each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this golden list, I still <unk> no, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> chief of American magazine or the <unk> executive of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, already that unlike the <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you end up your studies, and you have a copy and some jobs on your back, no matter what I mean, you would like to be president of the United States, but your gentlemen, you would have to be president of the United States for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yeah, pretty much the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first photo that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're getting into the personal terrain, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
So here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
These are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> people and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many inches in a <unk> and I would never use, except the two previous couple -- but the privilege that I get is what I get in real life, and that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and I was given the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> and he jumped on a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in power to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege by my way, I don't think of what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price to look like no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the <unk> of <unk> adolescents who stood up and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino people in New York City, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I get <unk> and <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes into <unk> percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little thinner and you have your hair, you'll feel very happy and beauty.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, clever and passionate people.
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what happens in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the smartest hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> and the brightest hair and the most <unk> and the most insecure women of the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something that will retain from this talk, I hope that everyone will feel more comfortable when we recognize the power of the image of the image of the image of the success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos -- and I wasn't me who <unk> them.
There were no directors, directors, directors, and no chance to repeat the photos, not even a <unk> in the lighting in light.
In fact, most of them took a random tourists in fact.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife brought me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
And it happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I came up with the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take me to New York on a <unk> journey, and you follow the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that were going to be <unk>
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, never has any of the camera yet.
So we were not aware of how much of us would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five-year-old could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They are also a way to stop in a week in October and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, though we've always got the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spent together is something that we expect with illusion all the year.
Recently, one of the trips -- we were walking, when suddenly he stopped in my tracks and pointed a red <unk> of the Lego store that I wrote from small in the previous sight.
And he described to me what felt like for five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who reminded his heart of beating the force to see that place for the first nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York is universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participate in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I am always the one that takes the picture.
So today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you didn't get it on to come up with somebody and ask him, and you take a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
There's also been associated with Disney laughter <unk> like <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> But I don't accept.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not keeping the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better <unk>   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who found mainly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are they <unk> they're important, first of all, they provide vital ecological services <unk>
It's our natural garbage <unk>
They were able to see the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria and they help absorb anthrax than it would not be for them to stretch and cause huge losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are not <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of spreading diseases.
<unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the lip <unk> and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto, and below Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do a few very important <unk> in the open culture, and in places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead up, or wood to make them, so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical endangered list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall out of the consumer consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India, and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs on the street in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs and you have a huge bomb bomb, and the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up of the Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. It was in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible <unk> trade to serve the <unk> and the market market.
So what is it? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that travel across different countries, so focus on an active problem is not going to be at all.
We have to work with the governments at <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these amazing creatures and the services that we have.
How can help help? It can become active making noise. You can write a letter to their government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you walk out of this room, you will report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed because he saw it fly without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these amazing species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do and everything that I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
And from <unk> to 1977, <unk> young man, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia. Kenya, East of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead, everything that we played was <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we got to <unk> <unk> to the southern valley to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we taught the local tomatoes and Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, the people weren't at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't have a few times --  We were glad that local products in so fertile valley, would not have been agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow up to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to them, "Look at how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it all.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> You never <unk>
I thought that only we have Italians to do errors in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, did what the English did, what the English did, what the English did, and then to see what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that we would give to the <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western countries, Western countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It was part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the <unk> <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture like my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture in a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
And that book gave me a slap in the face. "The small thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a stick on the ground and said, we can -- we can -- you can just imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided at 27 years only to respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start at anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion -- the <unk> of local citizens who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You never come into a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from office offices.
We sat down in a coffee. We sat down at a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what do you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not a time, they <unk> but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what would you have a <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't end up to your public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family member of the company, the family of the business of the business who sets up with you at home, on the table in your kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of living a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia,
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this junk garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So the government is done by 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter says Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
The planning is the kiss from death of the corporate spirit.
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most successful people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to conversation with you.
You have to offer you <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> will come into mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
So what do you show you -- you've got more of this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossils -- <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story, which in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the next year, he gathered this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wasn't within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk>  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty dirty technology that would <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States in the United States -- <unk> generic manufacturers <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days -- <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
Yet, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to conversation with you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have fantastic marketing and you have to count on a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and search for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't been born.
We have tested and looked at the 100 companies icons from the Carnegie world: <unk> <unk> -- all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one, no one was started by one person.
Not the word I, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins with a company itself.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment -- <unk> coffee in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who speaks to this <unk> someone who is talking to you, "What need to you?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can imagine, you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for cows stores so our communities can reflect our needs and dream?
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> who give shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries, and I trust I trust a city.
It always gives the music.  There's a parade in New York City --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one of the most <unk> <unk> properties of America.
I live near this house and I thought how I could turn it into a more pleasant space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
his death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and it was dead.
And this made me deep gratitude for the time lived and lives.
He offered the significant things about my life today.
But let me take this look at my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turn the wall out of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her phrases to <unk> Before she died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> to reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die, I want to be judged by <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die, I want to give you a more."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope of people who made me laugh at <unk> and made me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's all about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving the reflection of the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what the most important thing is for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year, and I started receiving hundreds of <unk> people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center we did a kit and now have been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give ourselves the opportunity for ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it is more important than ever, to get the ways to conserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
death is something we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that would be more power.
It's going to think of death in our life and our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as the community and more media to share with sharing hope, the people around us cannot help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old and very <unk>
Don't speak, but it delivers joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
It's shared. <unk> happens to happen.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at color color.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this: he has never been <unk>
When I singing our childhood, trying to tell the words that I couldn't even be able to <unk> it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that every year I went out of my iPod <unk> conversations that we kept when I was four years old, you pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of <unk>
Isn't that amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your mind doesn't fit into the concept of normal, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even if that was the case, even if you wouldn't consider it inside it, that only could mean one thing: they were autistic autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there to be so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that fast increases in the world, there are no known <unk>
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
It was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It's a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He lived alive and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in the room around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating whatever it would have <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, when I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change the normality.
<unk> happens to the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean you're wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could imagine, one single thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each one of us has a gift inside and frankly, the pursuit of normal, is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change die at the time in which we try to be as much as others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me a professor of communications, who gave a class of communication to students from engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> from these students with his great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But when they develop those conversations -- I felt what he would have felt like when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like that I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a huge communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care -- among others, and if we don't know about this, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their amazing world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
And so what science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply to study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care of <unk>
The slang is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same as making them silly ones.
Instead, as Einstein said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do <unk> <unk> kill, kill, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's being supported by the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> Tower of <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a bit, and then then provide graphics that we will contribute to our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding what it is <unk>
I think these are just a few key that can help each other open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, through all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the <unk> of English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor called the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge no matter of all, platform or principle, and that when he wins, it gets through the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something about words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the <unk> <unk> who was confronted with <unk>
He ran in the Tower of London and she <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first record of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as the <unk>
Most people think it's a literal question.
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. People in the U.S.
Not very <unk>
Some of you just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for a fixed term.
And there might be <unk>
The whole world got tired of it, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> grade with this <unk>
What caused himself and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives went against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be able to power.
They didn't want to call it King if he did it or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more and more unfortunate title than it came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. Not invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a trivial title.
And that's why the Senate gets off.
They said, "Well ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign up and meet with <unk> <unk>
And who is going to be serious with a degree as ridiculous and insignificant as President of <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't get.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the title of President.
President Barack Obama was lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one measurement is <unk>  <unk> possible that we should keep waiting for years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you, is that the title of President in America doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to note, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of aerial aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have done by the title of <unk>
So he won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they are now President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to give it to you.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes the words that the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it is hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones <unk> with primitive tools.
Like each other, I take a cheap flashlight of light <unk> attached to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
I took my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> who lost the control and dropped countless feet into that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the deep out of that hole in risking their lives without paying rewards and often dying.
I walked out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the <unk> Peace <unk>
Among all the incredible people that I met there met an <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO that has been dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was the world in the world, but not to just degree.
When we end up talking about it, I was very <unk> I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me get choked up, and I went up, and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even, I thought I thought my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are now more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of displaced Africans during the whole task of slave slave
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
This is equivalent to a few million dollars today.
But today, you can also provide whole families for generations per Child debts per year.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
What slavery is operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those of them are produced are disposable them.
<unk> exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the furnaces of bricks.
This weird and frightening show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 C, men, women, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> stack of mechanically ventilated <unk> <unk> <unk> stack into their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from the blast furnaces to hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> was that it was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera turned too much turned too on, and so he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning and sat there, and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back on the furnaces I wanted to cry, but the <unk> which was on my side and he grabbed me very quickly and said, <unk> don't do it." Don't do it here."
And I was clearly explained to demonstrate to emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just me but for them.
It couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and to work inside the system for their release and he trusted you in which you did.
As soon as me, I waited to get home to my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children in the Himalayas, they took stones to take rocks for miles per <unk> and they were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge and the kids put them on their heads with straps <unk> made out of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to look so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some don't even know that slaves are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They don't have anything to do that.
When these villagers were born, their freedom, the <unk> <unk> completely <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness -- I realized that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It was led to a little <unk> <unk> that gave these <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as they're known in craft, they are locals of <unk> prostitution as well.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of as only seven years -- are forced to come up to the clients and help me buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and dirty and identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a fear <unk> and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck trapped in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs the stairs which I <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows big enough for <unk>
These people don't have <unk> and, since we play a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people who, in agriculture, in <unk> in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex slave every year.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often associate with <unk> labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families living in the trade of the silk.
This is a family portrait of a family.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My <unk> told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in Lake Volta, the biggest artificial lake in the world.
When we come, I went to take a quick look at it.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, a few older kids, some more young kids, make sense of it?
<unk> were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families <unk> they have been forced and forced to work extensive in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This kid is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> I think his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The branches of the trees immersed in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and <unk> and fear of water to unleash the branches.
Many of them were <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries to younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they woke up the last networks, but they had been working from the one one.
The night cold and <unk>
And you would point out that these networks are weigh over 400 kilos when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi Kofi was rescued in a village in fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk>
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his compost suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
It was asked by a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would get us out of the car, and asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then he pointed out this <unk> path and said, "This is the track, this is the road.
As we started down, we took out the <unk> that we went on the road, and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I put it in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
Many women had children strapped to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in waters <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pit they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his <unk> <unk> <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits are going to be 90 feet and these people have got heavy heavy bags of stone that then they are going to be attached to another area where the stone was able to extract the gold.
At the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the place, you see to work at a less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> of drought in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, he <unk> her debt to the uncle of the uncle who force him to be slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines 14 and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, nevertheless, it is forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he dream he was released and gay activists with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, to face a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw a light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will have testimony about them and that we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves as humans, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazines. They are people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful, beautiful people -- I've had the great honor to know.
I hope these images show a force in those of you who see them in people like you, and I hope that force will turn a fire and that fire <unk> about slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do <unk> <unk> and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like management levels.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
And we would tell us the <unk> of the ballet and the <unk> dancers -- that we'll see later.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, burning gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> which, at the time, it was a virtuous <unk>
In the last few years, it has been a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we will know whether there is really a cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis and best we have is a <unk> neurological exam.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of the clinical trials, they never have been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a journey to clinic. What if patients could do the exam they are?
Not personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the clinic <unk>
So what I want to you with as a conventional not conventional for a try, you see, in a certain sense at least we are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds like that. We can imagine as dancers of a vocal message: because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed for example.
And as they did it, it takes a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can trace the vocal chords of the vocal chords as we <unk> and like Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the organs.
And on the traces of the bottom here, you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They make very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a little bit so <unk> it comes up to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to help address.
We can reduce the problems with patients.
I wouldn't have to go to the clinic for <unk>
We're monitoring <unk> we could get clinical data.
We could do a massive <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So by giving you today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices across the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or <unk> it can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I <unk> taking all of these samples from -- say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who is wrong.
What do you take of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, a few people may not be <unk> You may not have it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances it's important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in pursuit of the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> of accuracy at this time?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works on mobile phone network too, which is going to take the project, and we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March in the 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> gray.
We lie in the dark, in the dark rooms and we usually avoid the solar light.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect <unk> even more perfect -- we do the impossible, we could and we become the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> there was <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we heard that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 traveled to <unk>
It's a small <unk> village in <unk> <unk> of nearly 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave affected by the wave.
<unk> water level recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers into the ground.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
It is rubble from channels and <unk>
We had schools -- and we removed the slime and we leave the lists so ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We loved it, and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors were found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
Let's take them to take them to different places from the towns around them to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures made a huge part of the personal losses that those people had <unk>
As they went through the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a center of <unk> in the village.
He helped clean up the toilets, <unk> the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> are the photos.
And then I had the honor and I had the honor that that day would be <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until moved through myself my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of them who had over a hundred years, some were still in the lab on the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook and contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we began to tinker with the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get up with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In the other way, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
At the time of time, they got a lot more photos and they got more <unk> and so it went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks there was 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan, in July, we would invite you to <unk> a village in northern <unk>
Once we used our scanner into the libraries of the temporal field that had been <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the course of the photos.
It could be <unk> I could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw almost by hand using a guide and <unk> areas that the water had no <unk>
So I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures consumed by seawater, consumed by bacteria, with algae, and even <unk> all of that together with the step of the time I continue <unk> so I <unk> on hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't tweak the photo unless it was clean, dry and would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with the <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the photos as well.
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of lucky to the photos.
She had started <unk> her own, but he stopped realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to take the images in a single photo and tweaking the whole picture.
When I picked up his photos shared some of his history with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble quite far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues got it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his younger son at least I was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that wouldn't have been marked by that day from March when everything in his life changed or <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up to <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up to <unk> more than <unk> photos -- the vast majority came back to their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 percent of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would use, but the first thing that we would want to look for.
This is about the project, of restore small pieces of humanity, of giving back their connection to the past.
When a picture like this gets back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a big difference in life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- I connected something bigger -- using their talents for something that aren't thin models of perfect skin.
So I would just like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
While I was born, I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular photo is a photo with women of different ages from grandmother to the little child, <unk> around a baby, and I was embarrassed because a little bit like my family my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> <unk>
The whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that passes an apple in an exhibition from just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
So I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video in slow motion in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond your line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it down and <unk> it in a <unk> of second or so, in a number of <unk> to create a collection of photons just just a millimeter away.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a bullet in common.
So if you take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you spread those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now all of this --   remember, all of this is actually happening at least in a <unk> is what it takes for us to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to do this research --   <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a photons of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is going to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights from the top of the bottle, and after various boxes, that the insights will be <unk>
Now, if you take a bullet in common, and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow to about 10 billion times, how much of you think it would take us to sit to see that film?
<unk> A week? Actually a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie on motion.
And how about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table, the tomato and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way nature looked at a picture, he thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at this <unk> you'll notice that as the light gets rid of your tomato <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside and goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if you take a photo at low exposure, it goes into a very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so you just get some light.
And we had that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded one and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those data into crude and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to look after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the front door, you go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and you go from there to the camera.
Where we could extract these multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall, there's a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera -- but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capabilities.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects but we don't know what a dot corresponds to the distance.
When you project a laser you can record a photo <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
We can see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction one.
We have things for exploring before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is at the turn of the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows by looking at open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to look at the inside of the body <unk> <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and blood this is quite difficult, so this is really a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new framework of visualization to solve the problems of future health in the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, I turned science science -- an art of photographs of photos.
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected every time not just for scientific visualizations but we can imagine.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow camera and piece of colors.
And look at those waves, remember, time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here also happens something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects. And Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events occur in the world are sometimes invested in front of the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can make you life, and you give you freedom freedom.
With a cell phone, it can lead a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, and you can get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people have been looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people who were <unk> that they were looking for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who do you have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your phone.
<unk> An Android, <unk>
It's a lot of all of you today have a cell phone.
But today I'm talking about my mobile, and how life changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
It's raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. was presented to a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every country of Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sent a text to <unk>
And if we use the phone, where do we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or their Internet <unk>
And all over Europe people stood on and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret Police of Eastern Nigeria.
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store this whole information about us?
Whenever I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone phone <unk> that at that time, I was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information I had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete response. It was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, we won't give this information.
At the end, he agreed.
<unk> demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> of information.
At the beginning, I saw them and said, well, it's an enormous archive.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to happen.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you want to go back and go forward.
You can see every step I give it.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control its society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who send you an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a cell phone in the pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and business agencies want to store as much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to take them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home to their friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century, and it's not gone away.
When you go home, you get to your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that give you to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me into the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and so I have <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one had the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were happy brothers, though they are.
It only happens by accidents, like the one that I happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration and I don't want any of you in the room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
Christmas Day, they're in the shopping center, drive it in search for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
Also, I say, I have 99 problems, and the P. C is only one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm Palestinian <unk> woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I am from Park.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same starting age.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I was <unk>
If my three sisters would come to public school, my parents would send the school system and get rid of that I was also outside, and if we didn't take any of the ultimate note -- I got my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five to placing my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that you could do it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion which has gotten a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be all of the family.  I think no one realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> like a campaign.
The people I grew up with no trouble with my faith.
Yet it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger in the <unk>
I was telling them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to <unk> or I am I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer holidays on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't coming.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to fall into <unk>
In the summer holiday my father was often about <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> I got to get warm cups on my back, I was lying in the <unk> Sea, and I remember that the water would take me out my eyes and I remember <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before making yoga was a comedian of <unk> that he couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents would tell this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk>
Everybody <unk>
I did all the things about the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk> teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow on Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "In order to have a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of it, we finally did it.
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, <unk> historically, as if somebody would have killed my cat, and ask him why and she told me that because they thought I could not do the scenes of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the scenes, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role that he literally had been born and gave him to an actor and no cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I <unk> I went home, and my first tour <unk> was as an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> <unk> <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> principals not <unk> <unk> not white, with disability.
You just get to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took a famous poem from New York to New Jersey to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that I took when I was going at high speed on the New Jersey freeway, with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs of the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, no censorship and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little sound that women are not fun, and they found us very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and dad, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> New York City, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and at the time to remind the directors of path that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma in disability.
My great opportunity was in 2010.
I went like invited to the news news program by cable <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance, I went to a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the head and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the news desk to not come out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew I would not have got me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was kind of like <unk> at full time and pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that the kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or a little girl or so.
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I read clips online with comments like, "Why would you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What does it have?
We should really be praying for her."
A <unk> suggested I even would add my disability, to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't make somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, but I don't think it will be.
I hope that together we can create some positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the entire society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity, to give children Syrian refugee kids, a tiny part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father seen me live in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in <unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young town.
I don't know her name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small village to the Southern <unk>
This people are close to <unk>
<unk> lead to a small village to poverty and the brink of <unk>
No nothing for him, he goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there is no job, no time <unk>
He just was living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he gets a little bit about a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner to dinner, and after dinner.
And you bring a dynamic to a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to get bought out of new clothes, money to send home to their family.
They present to a young girl.
And finally they house.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts out a bomb.
That boy from that little boy with dreams of the great city was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little boy in a small town trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that he got rid of what we call <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It is the story of the <unk> young urban urban riots that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, which are finding something beyond <unk>
For young people, the promise of town, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, well-being, but young people don't engage in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in our growth in our cities, if they don't give them opportunities -- the history of the <unk> of <unk> the door to access to the violence, to the <unk> will be the story of cities going on.
And in my hometown of birth, by 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital in front of me thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had forced me to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some young leaders at a business walker.
<unk> about 90 European leaders <unk>
We sat down and had an rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because he was a graduate student, <unk> frustrated, it was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle for coming from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
She started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time expanding hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think that entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They were giving young people to be the creators of the economic opportunity that are searching for so long.
And you can train the young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was able to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business design.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until he was recently -- until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from all abroad.
If you beat somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company from <unk> and <unk>
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> that he said, they could survive the <unk> climate of <unk>
And he began the delivery of flowers for materials, creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies in the city, and now is working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and, like he says, sniff the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't cultivate pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO working for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, they might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We inspected business solutions for local problems.
So I inspire young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurial spirit, it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas reality.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them into developing and set out of their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support that they need to go from conception of conception of creation, and create a <unk> for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His <unk> <unk> this is how it's called, when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids out of the street to help rent and maintain <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn to young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains in the mountains in the North New York state in New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was doing that the leaves and the leaves like a <unk> and it won't be on the way that we were going to <unk> almost we could pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed on a <unk> with sight of a beautiful lens on the lens when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> aluminum balls, and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that they were too lazy as to pull out what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was <unk>
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how you call it, or where do you get the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> <unk> our trash -- for 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facility in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more <unk>
So I started working as a trash yard.
Now I didn't just ride in our trucks. I <unk>
And operated the mechanical mechanics and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong one will become very quickly.
It costs a lot to get up to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still beating the weight of taking over their tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> waste is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and getting into traffic all day all day swirl around you.
You just want to do it, so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is filled with dangers that often fall out and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about what's relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is as a force of nature itself.
He never stops coming.
It's also like a breathing form or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think the <unk> of waste are the most important workforce in the streets of town, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective form every day, this starts to hide from their container and its dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
Now, we had controlled for decades and centuries back and start <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have room for what the drivers of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out your relationship.
And then there is what I call our average performance as we need.
I mean simply by the speed that we used to move forward at the time.
We usually don't care about it, and we would be able to be cleaned up or we have our cup of coffee, our bag of water <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a force force on the other side that will get to it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about garbage collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every single day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to go?
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that they keep us safely safely from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow will always stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection on the street, he grabbed my little son, I went down the stairs and I went down and I had a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be good."
Shortly after that, I started investigating the waste collection and went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> and we worked together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have seen all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
The municipal waste that we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the number of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next to see somebody whose work is to clean up the trash of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on connection to thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the ultimate piece of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a commercial center for a number of stories in the Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining of the crystals generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's about a temperate climate that is about 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third, what has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for being as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, he was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure in the open air, where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
That's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how do we build a building modern building, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a very much area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, not there.
And it's also between two streets parallel that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs from the building.
And it extends with a <unk> <unk> which creates an open space in the building that would spread through its own form, of sun and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that was going to make the local climate conditions.
And I set up to think about a fabric like a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air air, and also the light, but in a <unk> fashion.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and that helped me model it.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that let rise air and light in a way controlled in the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what you get.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was actually going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in order to end accounts for they sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which are set up water for toilets inside.
For the early early principles of the next year, since we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that is so big, the biggest thing that I have is designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also his environment, his tradition and culture.
So during that analysis, I was especially interested in <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen connected access door connected straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was expand the streets and create 12 similar early blocks in size and features to those in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some <unk> points in relation to the idea of the interconnected doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So you have a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It's got these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to the local norms that set up a greater density at higher levels and a lower density in the plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community to the space of space occupied by construction.
It is where all the neighbors, they can go up and <unk> and do activities such as a <unk> career, in the morning, or jumping from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that they improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright amounts of hair and a little <unk> of pens, cute little <unk> beautiful for the capitals very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of <unk> until I got my sinister sinister plan.
And one day I stayed at a time after the age of school, I was a little late and I was amazed in the girls' bathroom.
When the shoreline was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's book <unk>
And then I did.
I took the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few <unk>
All the <unk>  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> we would take the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them from <unk> and myself a row in the way, just to be there, because he <unk>
I still surprise what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was all <unk>
I never <unk>
But above all, the reason I really disturbed me, the reason I really bothered me that this little little girl would be so small to <unk>
<unk> me jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that looking at zero, or long duration or sadness.
So we have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab where you study them in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no exaggeration to say that if there was no literature.
Well, he wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
He would not have King <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
There were no Shakespeare.
I took the high school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the <unk> it almost has all of them all.
This year will be done by 100 years of his masterpiece, "In looking for time <unk> the most precious study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> my own, all we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of the <unk> right?
We thought about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forget about how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a <unk> narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get too close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
As I have storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details that details to nail the knife -- right?
<unk> make us all <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now.
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every <unk> cool thing that <unk> detects in his lover adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> de <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break through it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like large amounts of hair, bright hair and cute little <unk> of <unk>
You get them out of the photos.
That's why Instagram it's so successful --  <unk> links nicely with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listening to the gates and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're <unk> scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what to <unk> <unk> the more agonizing the truth of it.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these are the pathways for the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman to whom we need to do -- it causes us to figure out a range of much deeper feelings and vital than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open up in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at with so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud had been visited by a young young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife would kill him.
And Freud says that there was something weird in that man who doesn't fit in what his wife was.
Well she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without no cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without noticing it, behaviors <unk>
<unk> <unk> or was accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels described very well how <unk> make us <unk> but not precision.
In fact, the harder we are, the more we are, the more we are becoming residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking of myself when I was eight years old -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which they were sent <unk> to itself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when I or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge if you give creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
As a <unk> <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to figure out how we have them <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk>
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to hang out of your self and <unk> what you ever want, and it's under the floor -- your name, is carrying your <unk> cow <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road for Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show you. I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> thinks of the curse curse at Professor <unk> that criminal genius could.
But I have always had <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers him.
Oh, I sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we <unk> it with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once we <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to give you the hand.
It's one of the times we see <unk> stepped back in history. I find this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being he <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the greatness in the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have fiction to <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> he invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big trouble.
The 21, July of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> of Apollo 11.
Armstrong and guards were alone, but their presence in gray gray is the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest mobilization.
To get to the moon -- NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo crew pictures.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which went out after the Armstrong behind the past year, is now the most <unk>
So why would you <unk>
They didn't have been a lot of <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is, because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the own Kennedy words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. So some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why are we climbing the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly about <unk>
Why does Rice play <unk>
We chose going to the moon.
We chose going to the moon.
We chose going to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the East of the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the wonder of the transcendence of the technology of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> was <unk>
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew 40,000 miles -- <unk>
From 1970, no human being has returned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo crew of <unk> and <unk> optimism about the power of technology has evaporated to see that the problems we imagine that the technology would solve as to go to Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a result of it.
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't get to the escape <unk> tube from the rocket <unk>
I knew this would be the last <unk> <unk> but I was completely sure that I would be going to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard this for the two last days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have <unk> us and have enriched toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They <unk> and enriched our lives.
But don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an explanation for Silicon Valley, which is that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which they <unk> <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, and particularly the incentives that risk capitalists are offering entrepreneurs that are offering entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments that could come out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest in a benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and development whose development is long-term capital, not in the long term, but they have not invested in the developing technologies because they don't have any commercial value right away.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we don't solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from sources of energy as solar as solar and wind -- less economic and the reason is completely economic <unk>
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want the sources of alternative energy that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- development of energy <unk> <unk> a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in political climate in which we will see a U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they are not going to be.
We know that the famines are a result of the failure to the food table.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and delivery of food, but there will be famines as well as governments.
Finally, large problems are sometimes getting a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon was told to read the war on cancer in 1971, we discovered that there are many types of cancer <unk> some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and have -- but these four elements have been <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to address the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we should understand it.
The mission mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, does it do with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's not a popular mythology of fiction science like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, is a very widespread subject.
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I will bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to the opinion polls and the opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were being <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, follow <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they remain quite a <unk> of the judges, the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway away.
But is this evidence enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people feel when you get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
I would probably go for asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you answered the question, "Well, I trust a few other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put trust <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence that we are going to feel like by a certain kind of a <unk> officer or a kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I would say, for example, saying that I trust a certain elementary elementary school that I know to give the type of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> fashion.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of trust, because they're trying to provide good inherent trial to actually trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to get more confidence in what it is trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who were doing their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you tell it, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is it about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in <unk> and it's responsible for and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible? We couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that I would look at their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it is like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're <unk> to focus on before we trust.
Now, trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to be.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that made us easier to judge their reliability.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
And I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative <unk> that I will go through -- you know, <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system is destined to secure the top of the top, and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You must have all of you know the similar examples.
They were all going to do that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and things would be different if they were to be worthy of trust and <unk> to people that we are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, the simple action, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But the trust, in the end, is signature because they give us <unk> other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't ignore it, usually all the time.
But you also have to attract <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, doing the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store in which I buy my socks is said I can get them <unk>
I take them and give me the money, or you get the change by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have trust that you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very difficult to <unk>
What people trust is in the relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've come up with us by reducing the separation between us and the digital, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be solved.
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more and more to the point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> display, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
I first created this tool that you go into the digital space, so that when the strong breeze against the screen provides your physical body into the pixels.
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs, under the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the <unk>
In the division of Sciences Sciences at Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a work digital area.
<unk> a transparent bombsight of deep cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the three-dimensional space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that there is below every floating screen.
The architects can spread or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if you invest the papers and we make the digital information come towards us?
Many of us will have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make them physical <unk> so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would the future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my fellow Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, that we created this one single physical car.
This imam <unk> it acts like a pixel in 3D space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
So what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> mechanical mechanical <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach physically and physically and distance and the famous power of Michael Jordan can be played as a physical reality, the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool for complicated concepts such as the motion of the planets, the physical movement, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks, and this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday activities.
As you can see, digital information will not only show us something but begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to get rid of our world.
So we started talking today about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was amazed to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to lead to a school to athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only an accurate way to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer but my dream.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult gave you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew that it was too much bigger to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to say, OK.
They went to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of Nan <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books going on here?
The ones that were eradicated in China, of course.
<unk> Good <unk> tries Chinese life.
And it's not about a convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And I find it with a new culture also led to my reading habit.
They have a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me outside of place, because this is what students in China learn.
It would never have occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like religion and comparative literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading would work for research, why don't we do it as well in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two to two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For 2006, <unk> are economic and <unk>
By Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty of Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> path, Alan <unk> Instead of missing in the translation, I found that you can earn a lot of it.
For example, this is through translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect people from the past and the present.
I know that I'm not going to feel like <unk> or <unk>
Having a dream <unk> is not really anything compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the fact is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion comes from, where your happiness.
Until a dream <unk> can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a graduate student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> encountered stood up on the couch in my office and took his shoes off and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> as a first customer.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories, that Alex brought to the sessions, was made me easy just to move the head while they were to make the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> saying Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start working after that, then you start to work later, you have children later, to death later.
By the <unk> of Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming up with guys under his category they were lying with a head <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe it gets <unk>
Also, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, the people feel head after what they did, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time, and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of benign grasp. was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody comes to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream a <unk> I want to see. It's fine. We the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give your life to life have gone past when they have 30 and <unk>
People from over 40, not trained to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or are coming out with their partner partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up for its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change yourself, now it's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life and we know that female fertility comes to its top 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time to tell them about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact.
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in developing adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> names <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and nothing happens, absolutely nothing.
And then every day, the very interesting <unk> like you or your kids and your daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not really good for me, but this relationship doesn't just kill time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that when I start a career before the 30, everything will be good."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better copy the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, and they were <unk> but then at some point about 30, he turned music and all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing I'd been standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of extreme -- but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, you choose a city, choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle of middle-aged age is not about buying red sporting cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want right now.
You see, you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about his <unk> "What was you doing? What was thinking?"
I want to change what the people are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
In 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said you'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, it was alive with a boyfriend, who showed the most <unk> that ambition.
And despite living a few very difficult life, his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our sessions, but then they went up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma came up with his legs and he cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many links -- but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words "In <unk> please call <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I give me <unk>
At that time, it took a lot of hard to resist and I don't say, <unk>
The thing that Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like to just sit with Alex like the decade <unk> of Emma happened.
So over the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that you would get rid of that identity crisis, and the identity capital of identity.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital of identity creates identity capital.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, that <unk> of that company you want to give it.
So I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't tell -- which by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma to explore jobs and make them tell.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are excellent for you to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds to who you know, how you know, how you think about, how do you talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who was going to come out almost it comes from their closest circle.
The new things come from what they call <unk> <unk> friends of friends of their friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or don't have a job.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
The half of the work created never <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job of <unk>
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
For last but not less important, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma soon went to his family when he has a couple and form her own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now or you're going to tell you, now when all on Facebook, you start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have, and that involves being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want to rather than just doing it is going to work or kill a time with whoever is telling you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in the fourth of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That work of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend who was alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> especially in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
He took his new career, he loves her new family, and I send me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like flying out of Los Angeles, who come to some place in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, to the 21 or the 25th and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have enormous effects over the years or even the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
That's what I have now the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: and <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their identity, they get the identity capital -- use their weak <unk> they choose your family.
Don't let for what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to <unk> <unk> in New York City.
And like any teacher, <unk> tests and tests.
I give them assignments.
When the work came, it was <unk>
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance did not have any I.Q. I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn from mathematics in seventh grade, you are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for the time for time.
And after several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a direct perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if we succeed at school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to university to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the West Academy -- West <unk>
And we tried to predict what they were trying to do is we tried to predict the military training.
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied professors who are working in very difficult <unk> <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking, what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, it arose a feature as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good and the physical health and it wasn't I.Q.
It was purpose.
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my questionnaires of determination and then waited for about more than a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that the children who have more determination they had significantly greater likely to be able to get even though when I put them in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the <unk> tests, even the security they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point, or at the National <unk> of <unk> in which it matters about purpose. It's also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do the determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a good job <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the excitement is commonly related or is even related to proportional to talented measures.
Up until now, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk>
This is an idea that at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and growing in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to be <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, and we have to try and start to try and start with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most precious memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can pull down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that can do it.
I started thinking about how a new approach and quickly learning to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic furniture.
The first 200 will allow them to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read traffic traffic signals, it will understand the basic idea of the pages or the newspapers.
Today we will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were shouting at a <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> the shape of the flame -- but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple gates on the old West <unk>
I call sweeping these eight characters.
These are building blocks to create a lot more characters.
A person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old guy, two are company, three are a crowd.
If a person <unk> your arms, this person is saying <unk> and so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> just like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations <unk>
Put a mouth out of the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a tree is pretty an idiot.
Do you remember the <unk>
Two fires together, it's very hot.
Three piles together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the front door, ask questions.
<unk> had somebody at home?
This person is walking out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, keep care is <unk>
So we've already gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every small effort, they will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the Sun.
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun along the beginning, created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked into the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their own political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind remind me that I have to stop talking and pull down the stage.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz of Oz together.
The film was coming in, his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to wear a bright dress and take a magic dress.
But when you look at that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of an industrial complex fantasy show.
Yet the Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took over 40 years later on, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> guy named a girl dressed as a guard <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little <unk> violence in <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> are the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
You use magic shoes to defeat the armies generated by the computer of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician in Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did Star Wars <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, he also had a child.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level was <unk>  So he was so slid in the room and he was impressed by like a mom with her <unk> on behind, and I don't think he would understand what was happening, but, <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> <unk>
I should feel that Luke get an army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician.
How do you make Dorothy your movie?
We do good <unk> with all of them and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, and not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there that much force of capital F, that we force it in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence films in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that Princess Princess doesn't provide the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really expected them to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest is done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and defend the Disney princess in front of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they guys, they are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal work when they teach girls how to defend against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real, and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is continuing to appear in classic <unk> each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are <unk> a child.
Until as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is done a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens to <unk>
I don't know if you heard about this.
It's still not roots and already <unk> but maybe we're starting a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book books, and in the '80s, I recorded a conversation I'd had with a friend of the movie assessment that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to <unk> in the film, there's more of a female character that has <unk>
So you have to get the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are more than something else than the kid as I like?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see in the film we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> from <unk> success -- an idea of consensus about what is a film of Hollywood <unk>
<unk> doesn't happen <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden throughout the hostage.
We have a lot of scenes from men who have deep and painful conversations on this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, "Go to bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
And so it <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 popular movies, how many of them believe they have actors who are <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then is okay.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to take up this room.
The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it said,
In the United States, one in five women said it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I also don't believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a huge amount of <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, and then collect the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We're putting that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we find this world and this very <unk> statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools in our willingness to be <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children so that they have to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our kids -- a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that you look after the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star character from Star Wars <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the bright dress here.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to be less stories on which I told my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where I saw that their work is join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people better and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me to be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
Yet, at the time, I was terrified of <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I had my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of 1,000 miles of length.
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to using satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to look at another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the infrared
This is a place that's located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, the simple view, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we can process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing are the actual chemical changes of the landscape of the landscape of building materials and activities of ancient Egyptians and activities of the ancient Egyptians of the <unk>
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old American city, called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place places in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red dots here, but somewhere within this enormous <unk> of <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> per mile.
Before, The <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as he changed over time, moved to this and covered all of the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in an <unk>
And I'll try to find out at random that would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where we got the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated in the circle here, which you think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians making <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots of shown in ice, but instead of layer of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for it.
Five feet down, underneath a thick thick layer, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years dating back from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> quartz jobs, which shows that there was a jewelry shop.
This might seem to be a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Ages, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation showing up of the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop which shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we went to the place in a near future for <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also do great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire that was probably written in <unk> four years ago.
So share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So as it looks like, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually actually started in 1984 B.C. C in a lost city not long and found from the high.
It certainly puts up <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now I would take a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a whole form of bicycles and they're going to come to your <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of your house.
There's bikes to fly everywhere, wheels on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the front door.
In the lobby, to the hall, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that's speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> tickle on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you get to go into your mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained their living room.
Already in the room, and doing the most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with clothes, clothes, dancing over his journal <unk> singing <unk> I <unk> One More <unk>
Now you go to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a path of yellow <unk> and from the oven coming towards you -- the Man of the <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of my hands, jumping up to you.
All right. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> of <unk>
There were several men and a few women and two different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
And we would use the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
They provide entire poems in just minutes.
He was able to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the ultimate memories <unk>
And I said, <unk> when did you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using ancient <unk> invented two and years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used <unk> to memorize their narratives and that the <unk> <unk> used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I not hear about this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English <unk> although a little <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live, on national television.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the start of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up having the bulk of the year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a <unk> problem, it's awesome.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that lets you see how much our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is <unk> <unk> he was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the back, I read a bunch of treaties on the written memory something about 2,000 years ago in Latin America, and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having a <unk> memory and <unk> was not a thing as rare as you might look like today.
It makes people invest in their memory, they will provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they've also changed us.
We have changed <unk> and I would say that we have also changed any cognitive <unk>
As we almost have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where we are still passionate about this idea of a <unk> memory and <unk> and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are skills like this all around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College in London invited a memory of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, to be that there is brains in some way, structural or <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they even smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> battery and the answer was actually no.
There was yet very interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory and the control brains and the control of the control with the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> MRI machine, <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory of memory you find out parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> <unk> is driving as a career armed where each year has come up with somebody with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of those competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory champion,
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely the techniques for the end of the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
And it illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox -- <unk> <unk> he says this: I say two people who remember the same word.
That's his name.
And then I ask you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I went back later, and I ask them to tell them that word I told you about a <unk>
You know what <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told that his work is <unk>
Same word, different <unk> capacity -- that's weird.
What about here?
Well, subsequent name, doesn't really mean nothing for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They were good at getting home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two and a half thousand years ago in <unk>
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> that I attended a <unk>
I had hired them as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't get to a <unk> you get to a poet.
He stood up and <unk> his memory poem, and he <unk> and as soon as the <unk> hall.
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed all of them, but they shattered the celestial bodies, <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with your eyes in his mind, I could see where I was sitting every single <unk>
He took family <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What <unk> flew at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and that is that no matter if we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If I told you to tell me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about today -- it's very likely to find them very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who was sitting on the horse Warner recovered. In his lobby, they would be capable of <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with your eyes and image of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first treated in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you're invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way that I would have done it, if you had invited him to <unk> for 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And it will come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy crazy thing to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine you get into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind that anecdote <unk> that you want to tell.
And then they walked into the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk about would be that strange journey that made for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their speakers, not word <unk> which is going to confuse you, but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek that means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first of all, it would be like the first place in his <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with it.
I went to some of these memory skills and I had the idea of writing about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
But seriously, is like seeing a lot of people sitting on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody else <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times simply trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a marketplace of <unk>
And I discovered that this was funny <unk>
I would have never expected I was.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What is really about doing is getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- specifically <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and some cups of safety covered with tape leaves two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk> memory.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve in good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on early principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from <unk> to benefit from how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even overwhelmed indeed.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them is not <unk> over there.
But the reality is, there's no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what I want to leave you with today, is what I would not even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose out of what is already our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> it doesn't pay attention to the human being in front of us, who walk on our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so let's just put it up just a New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they were all over time watching television and so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone would see me, and every time I got it up, and I went back in a towel -- everyone was seeing me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not safe and hated it.
I took that tour, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of area, but of those kinds of emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
So 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it because it was based on a building that was built two and a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an amazing emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build museums on art.
And in the 20th century, in America, we used it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very helpful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are doing the <unk> and the governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a beautiful <unk>
This is the Public Public <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got a <unk> it has this round thing -- he's got this round thing -- columns red that <unk> <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for town, a place to come up, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On the one hand, the architects who are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We have tried to do it and we tried it so much, that we get away from the people.
And all of the black, it <unk> us -- you think we feel very well, but we're dead in it because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side, and we are going to connect with these symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experiment with them, we do <unk> the pendulum back and over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, I <unk> in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It's got to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started collecting those symbols.
We put the back back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and <unk>
We add neon and we added <unk> and we use new materials.
They love them.
We don't give <unk>
We took vanity <unk> and we made them <unk> that can be <unk> <unk>
The forms were <unk> they won on boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spent time in the <unk> and we moved into the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic fantasies <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or <unk>
Maybe with endless sticks of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols. We now have new computer design techniques and we found ourselves with new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum will come back in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when Bilbao and public and public were in general, they were completely According to a building.
The New York newspaper Times <unk> this building of <unk>
Tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So, all the world wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these are wild and <unk> how it's possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is going around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The world's biggest mayors in the world.
And so everybody believed that if they had a culture and development culture.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium, the other star.
He went to <unk> and to <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually actually starting to happen with all architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
Technology can work. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and ultimately, we are all photographers photographers photographers and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I know if I designed four years ago, it was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
That's how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> it's about 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen, because we're on the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel or <unk> and this is the media revolution.
My theory is that when the pendulum applies to media, it starts to <unk> faster and faster, until it gets to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and it was effectively <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, the architects, and you the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system system works on a project that my company ended very recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk> in the state of New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly in the community, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, because these are not just images of a building that you did from the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks telling us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was actually built today, first of course, to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> with examples of experiment about what it can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people from <unk> and tell them that there's no single answer to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience who doesn't embrace anything that has ever seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum beat from one style to another movement is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
That means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas of what is a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will become the whims of nature and not the contrary.
This means that a parking garage, in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to do sports or to <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East Side of New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community in the surrounding community around that cause, is no one customer alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> as <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more green and smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not only reflecting our society, but they give them a way to the most <unk> the local, the local libraries where we form our children, and the <unk> in the toilet.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does it in this great way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and it gives himself those <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do this, and he asked me to think, "When do you stop doing this?
How are we suddenly not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as a teenager, it only wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week, in school.
It's a little bit confused because even though his mom tells you all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Among the top of what her mom tells you and what your friends, or in the school says, doesn't know who to believe.
So he does a video of it, he puts it on YouTube, and he asks others who please leave a <unk> "Am I nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talked about a normal and ordinary healthy teenager, who receives these answers in one of the stages of their most emotionally vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure on being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young people.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand are <unk>
This environment is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no divide between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what it's changed? <unk>
What is the most important thing in somebody's life in front of what it's normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news news now.
<unk> <unk> keep our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people compare to.
But the kids aren't immune to this.
Like the <unk> <unk> stars, and the singers, <unk>
But what's the problem with this?
Well, you surely want our children to grow up and be individuals who are <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the picture, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to hurt.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think you don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and how to taxpayers and to the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the discussions of class.
One in five are not <unk> at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable on it.
And in the <unk> season, if you don't think you look good, well, specifically if you don't think you're pretty thin, <unk> a note less than the average of your fellow people who don't care about that of appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland United States and China and China.
And it gives you irrespective of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be very clear, so we are talking about how you're really <unk>
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
While teenagers with self-esteem is doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they're involved in more diet not healthy than they can take them to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that it's all over this by what they make more egalitarian decisions like alcohol and drugs, diet -- aesthetic surgery, aesthetic <unk> aesthetic sexual activity, and without protection and damage.
The search for perfect body is pushing up to the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of if they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not present to a job interview on a day that they don't feel safe in the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs never figured out the situation.
So we must make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are kind of starting to be crucial points for anyone willing to provide an education in your body understanding that works.
An education is fundamental but address this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
And the current status of how women are seen and talked in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians to <unk> or the size of your <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people so they are, not as you see them.
All of us can start by doing it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort, and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you would get a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow up to be valuing their own person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
So let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them come out of the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe they are never aware of being the ones who are who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
Your <unk> A <unk>
Could it just be the woman who is in two seats. What would it mean for her, if they were liberated from that <unk> voice, which was <unk> it was not having long legs -- <unk> more skinny, a <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her, if we were going to take this out, and we would allow its potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is holding back to everyone.
But let's take our kids to the truth.
We think that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and by what they do, and as they make us feel.
They respond to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And to work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they will become agents of safe themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
The five of November 2002, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense League <unk>
To <unk> initially as an innocent time, but being prisoner by other charges -- and the company of others, started planning attacks at about 12 icons from New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N. headquarters
Fortunately, those plans was inspired by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't be ashamed of.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being him an engineer who was a <unk> an American mother, master elementary school teacher -- between the two did all possible for me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims even come to know.
And for experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require much to make the same things in life.
However, in all of religion in all of us, in all human group, there's always a tiny fraction of people that are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible means that everyone lived as them.
A few months before he arrest him sat with me and explained to me that in the last week of week, he and some friends, had been going to go to university training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> that we got to know our group, was slowing by the FBI.
When I touched my father, my father helped me hold my <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet I shot at the little orange light on the goal and, for surprise of everyone, especially of all, the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
From such a parent, <unk>
All of all, the comment made a lot of laughter. But only a few years later, I understood what they found so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
These people later would be convicted of putting a van <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the North World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was a time to pack and go to another city.
As it was always me, the new face of the class was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white, but it's going to be the new of <unk> silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
I was raised opera to judge people, based on temporary indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my mind, was during 2000. presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I participated in the National Convention, <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence -- as I had been a victim of <unk> most of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who we have made, friendship, Jewish age.
It took several days coming out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and quite frankly, I was very proud to overcome the barrier that all of life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job, in the Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of my life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critical thing that I had seen in life.
Having been a child, developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me about a child, with the experience of the interaction in real life.
I don't know what that was the homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, does nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he turned my figure back into a moment that I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have a better influence in my life than my father -- <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was thinking about my way of thinking, and she told me something that will conserve in my heart forever, while I live.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred inside you.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody -- one day, who is trying to carry violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and by their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts of <unk> as rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put this <unk> that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that the children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Right now, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what they hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has it, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like when you project to your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film in your own, you, you and you.
There's nothing that we know more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of it.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to make results of the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
And science, by nature, is objective goal.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective one.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, it would look at that vision.
<unk> psychology studied human behavior -- neuroscience studied the human brain -- but never mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to do the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some state of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to you that this kind of work in neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness. And the questions about what certain areas of the brain and what it is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Not to offend the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well it doesn't address the real core mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk> movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give you a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they work on them, how do they expand and adapt to the living organisms and all the living organisms all are questions about how that target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and brain functions like a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we speak, how we play <unk> all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is it that all behavior is accompanied by an adverse experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that work. For a long time, I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for the reasons.
I think we're going to stand up at this point.
We have a wonderful wonderful explanation, great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
We don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think that consciousness right now, is kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our vision of the world, but we don't know how.
So with an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
So the whole idea of the subjective film has includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- and so he studies everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> awareness of the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying for consciousness.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space and mass.
<unk> laws like <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of <unk>
On the contrary, they think of principles, and there is the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts of space <unk> -- time, <unk> laws of Newton. And so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electrical load of the <unk> and <unk> the electrical load that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find out of consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, mass, mass, then for a matter of logic, you have to put it up the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the awareness itself as a foundation, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamental concepts -- the space, the mass, the mass, the mass processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want very simple laws that we can do it in a <unk>
The awareness of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find very simple laws that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when he thinks I always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling -- that will make some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy to you.
How would someone think something so crazy?
So part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea is <unk> it is much less for the people of different cultures, where human mind seems to be a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that are exploring the thinking with the physical process -- is <unk> consciousness with information.
There's always information processing -- there's a conscience.
<unk> in complex <unk> like in a human being, conscious awareness.
<unk> simple, simple information, simple information.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a means of information integration as significant, as significant as consciousness -- quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there's still going to be a different level of awareness of zero.
It actually brings up a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind the underlying reality.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is it coming from?
From the view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is what it puts fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
And this is a vision, I think, has the potential to protect our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical consequence.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything to have consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of starving.
I think that I think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical and moral terms is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information -- she has a complicated information processing -- so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you are all about ethical problems that are quite serious about the ethics of smart computers and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for <unk> <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, right now we have an collective collective consciousness, a internal movie for this whole group of TED -- different from each of the <unk> movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think that at least is a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually most sure of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a <unk>
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We cannot wait for the night to solve it.
But I think we finally will find it to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low profile of education.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, I would join my friends, the lower sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because he wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's really nice but there's a evident.
She has actually not gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. after school, I had a low profile.
Yes, I know. <unk>
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that I can think of as a achievement if we took the disability outside of the equation.
A few years later, he was in the second part of teaching me at a high school school, just just after about 20 minutes in the middle of the University of <unk> <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when do I give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about things that are going to do in school?"
<unk> in the <unk> <unk>
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people as an inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair and you're probably waiting for them to <unk> Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you've lied for disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is <unk> A <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes it fantastic for you.
It's not something wrong and it doesn't get to <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social communication.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without the hands of my hands with a pencil holding through the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the porn term, <unk> -- because we would engage a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, it will encourage the disabled people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, because of very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been concerned about strange <unk> to express that they think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was getting up in the morning and remembering my own name.  And this is <unk>
These pictures, those images were providing people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't as bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person, is actually a tough thing.
So let's make some things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled because of society in which we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
I need the things I need to do, and I have learned to get the best of their ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking away the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to be in the way that we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
Yet I don't know that I am so lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load the battery out of the mobile phone on the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance from each other, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and we <unk>
I really believe that the lie that you've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a mountain range has never done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not make the <unk> for people who were <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books at <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered to be <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be <unk> by getting up of bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child in the 11 degree in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but questioning what you think you know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
And when people think really <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure most of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way that I will be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would enjoy your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what is running through the field of game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know it feels like a man of 110 pounds of <unk> trying to help us with everything to be.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
And some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine rising up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible being <unk>
Just a moment. Give me a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk>
IBM's eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be their favorite players, and they have asked me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to teach you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a roller coaster for his life.
What is going to be the experience of a fan when he <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> which will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball into the bottom of the network?
What will be their experience when you were growing up from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not yet <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality when I <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a brief refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to their <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exhilarating, faster.
In 1994, the guy put on the <unk> on the <unk> of the field, and then on the walls of the defenses.
They got more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move that you have shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you don't have to worry about -- you don't have to worry about forgetting a <unk>
And by <unk> the strategy.
They just come out to the field and they react.
And the coaches want them because they don't follow their instructions, they lose games, and they hate losing games.
If you lose games of you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the sensors, and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
bad people will have the information <unk>
And this would take good people's good equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being for dinner."
Who would be also to <unk> Who would have thought?
So how would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk> of field.
And I put the ball and <unk>
<unk> at an open open, all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't know it, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
It <unk> the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's an open machine.
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in its bombsight is an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
He <unk> he takes the <unk> running and <unk>
The audience <unk> and fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
So I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
Let's just use it as bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings, to show someone how it is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth by <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show you a <unk> what is your actions from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay person in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality reality comes close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face -- as well as all of us.
Thank you.
I recently joined me after 23 years of service.
Most of those 23 years ago I had the country <unk> the southern tip of the county of <unk> including the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is the world's beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Golden <unk> was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a <unk> engineer who built the bridge, said that "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
Health from the bridge is not practical and no <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped their death from that bridge.
Some of them believe that travel between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every one from it will release you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit to suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water roughly 120 miles per hour.
The <unk> impact is our bones, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The fact that no, they usually fall into the water <unk> and then <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> that <unk> this method of suicide will realize the death of the death who is <unk>
This is the wire.
Except, around the two towers, 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people have been in order to get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker time, it's very difficult to bring you back back.
I took this photo last year while this young man was talking to an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that day we had success to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the road through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were <unk> but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met the <unk> 22 last year by receiving a call from a possible person who was sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try and suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> he created <unk> and he sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could get more than she did, and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind and smart guy in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, my family rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had had them order.
The damage suicide damage affects a lot of people.
So I ask them these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved <unk>
What about <unk>
How do you say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk about, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how they feel, because they probably won't.
Just there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask them the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
They went to the person in front of it can save life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do to do with <unk> social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and she wrote this email only a couple of days, and he is with her permission and blessing to <unk>
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends that tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father at the 19th of January.
It never got there.
He called the <unk> police <unk> and they <unk> it as a disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported me that Mike car was down on the bridge.
And one witness I'd seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the afternoon before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real infectious disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Golden Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful harbor not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I refer to hope and value.
On March March 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a possible guy who was a potential subject on the sidewalk near the northern tower.
I ran my motorcycle down the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, crossed immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided by his account that day I'll come back on that lane and give her life another opportunity.
When Kevin came out, I <unk> it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he do?" and gave us hope and life else <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
They stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from my mother's mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the March 11th, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin keeps with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly enough.
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits of all those traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like he says.
We give it to God for you.
<unk> at you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writing, <unk> -- when I visited the General Hospital in San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I did have to do that.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with hope that their story will inspire others.
Health is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather killed himself with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, MIT the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people who were <unk> or those who consider suicide, would not think of hurt someone else.
They just want your own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved just from three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
So for that time, I got my hand at three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two -- most of those people have said that the railing <unk> the railing realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be able to be done.
<unk> can prevent.
There is help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you get to it?
I have to be something that's only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner reality, with my <unk>
So for reasons, reasons, the ones that I go over later, when I look at this photo -- I thought, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that <unk> I'm just beginning.
We were all inspired by our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors -- many of my neighbors -- my friends, my agent even, my story.
I think this <unk> is a revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of my genital appearance.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why always take that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but we now know that it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never helped myself to share my story, not because it thought I am a bad thing, but why the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mother, Dad and a family who is a <unk>
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in African culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up with me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she said, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was going to <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in a suit, I won in a <unk> and he got a third <unk> in the top of 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was the queen of the beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they went to remote provinces of the <unk>
But more important than all of that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was hooked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know what if you asked the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I put two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at the age of 19.
It's curious that in some of the world's most rural cities to do the most sophisticated and sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to get surgery before they changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of her name -- <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears looked <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but he <unk> he actually put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global vigil for Mother's Day.
I am on this stage thanks to a long history of people who were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep my living alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> for any day there is no longer than 20 percent <unk>
My deeper truth took me to accept what I am.
Do you do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> <unk> first, to thank all of my <unk>
And my parents from support, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've ever been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and they told me that his parents couldn't accept it, I would take my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it does not. It's not just your gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender by birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes that <unk> no block, and that there should be a space that allowed people to think, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with <unk>
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known to her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education, defending his rights in 2007. And when he was paying for his efforts in 2011, and when he was signing up his efforts in 2011, the <unk> National Prize for peace, became a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of the inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when I was born a child, your birth is not <unk>
It doesn't stop by his father, not for his mother.
And the neighborhood comes back and forth, and he puts her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got very excited about having a little girl.
When you give birth to the first child, the first child, the first child, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother suffering, but the daughter <unk> <unk> when it comes up, suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you stay home and the school admits of her siblings.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow, in a good life.
Can you be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes in in adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you have to get out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if I had the code of that assumption honor, I could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption about honor, not only does it affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl is supposed to be very humble and very <unk>
That's the best thing.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepting decisions from their father and your mother and people's decisions even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to follow it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
I was <unk> and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, trust me, I don't like newborns, I don't like newborns, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And so much before I was going, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter for her.
But when I was <unk> everyone was men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came, when she was four and a half years old and a half years old, I was in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I have to be <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for a child life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One classroom to school means that has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations that it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before -- when I went to the form of tourist <unk> and I was in the relative of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters and his daughters, I thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I was going to sit around to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've made all these good values in my school and girls on the same way.
I used education to <unk>
My daughters, I taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation from women in political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls have been banned from going to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers that were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and I was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10, he got up and lifted up for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog <unk> he offered her himself for the New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the October nine of 2012, he was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between my life and death, "I heard her wife and <unk> <unk> so I spent my daughter to your <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
They would take your life in play because of the truth of peace, because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you <unk>
Both were on the right path, and God <unk>
These few words were going to be a lot to me, and I didn't get to ask again.
When I was in the hospital, I was in a hospital, and I had severe headaches and severe headaches of head because his facial nerve, was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> through my wife's face.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to say, "I'm well with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to do good. Please do not be <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> and sisters have learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm very pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any 16 <unk>
<unk> when he didn't have his homework.
They fight their brothers, and I'm very happy about that.
People say, "What's special about my mentoring that has done so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
It didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain about 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google -- but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
Do you be like smart or not?
Don't be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead sticky part of the center that it creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen of these powerful chemicals every day, because if you didn't take anything, she would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and piles of chemicals, and try to get them to stay alive.
Once I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try and get the dose of the <unk> because it really doesn't exist a clear map to say it in <unk>
I started testing with different <unk> and I was amazed by seeing how small changes in the dose dramatically -- dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I was, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and chemical chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was surprised to see how to look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've been known as a number of guys -- or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was having a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that he had on the front, and it just wasn't happening that way.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to do is I have to get better with men.
And what was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
We thought almost always in pictures, and that became my point of key <unk> how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like that.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
There are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds works, to me, to me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery is fundamental to the critical thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I could find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> and really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get these mental pictures of my mind to the screen of the computer.
Can you imagine what if a film director would be able to use your imagination only to steer the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music in his head?
There are incredible possibilities for this, as the way people creative can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that made by two recent groups in neuroscience.
Both both used technology <unk> image of functional fMRI -- to represent the brain. You see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and its colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you see it, looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube while they were tracking their brains to create a huge pool of feedback from the brain to video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer, using only scanning information <unk> to show you what it looks like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left-hand side, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're okay close to this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you look at an image and when you imagine that same picture, you create the brain itself.
This was done with the brain scanning systems systems available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution, a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we achieve this?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer you.
Many are proposing new projection techniques by imagery, and even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the <unk> first, we have to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets <unk> just offer small improvements on the resolution, not gains by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different things, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI is to do really big, right?
Yet most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> and brilliant and brilliant solutions on coding and <unk> in the transmitters and receptors of FM systems in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field, we get rid of magnetic patterns -- we harvest it into the radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns, we can increase a massive form of information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide our growing knowledge into the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity of this is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas on the direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have few options that will open up this door.
Anyway, you choose one year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet probably is to tell some person for the first time your love or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have through in life.
And so I'm going to come up with a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is kind of universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be aware that by the <unk> of my short <unk> and having caught me my head, I would ask me a little bit of my head to say, "Hey, you're usually a kid or <unk>
And it would show a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father of <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother got a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to go into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> of Gloria <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a deep breath, and I went down and I went down and back to my back -- a four-year-old girl with a pink dress with a pink dress -- just a little girl with a question: "You're a girl or <unk>
So I took a deep breath, again, I put myself out of <unk> about it, and I said, "Hey, do I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a child, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk> pajamas.
I am more from a girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all right, "Please be a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some statements in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons why we get out of my journey, it was harder to come out of his, but this is the thing: It's not <unk>
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared online online is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I say is harder than telling your five year-old son that you're going to do to you.
There's no more difficult thing, there is only the difficult thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult for us to think about what it is difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our amaze and we need to only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make sense of security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are made -- a closet not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine themselves 20 years ago.
I, who had a line of horse -- a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant <unk> to fight any <unk> <unk>
I was frozen because of fear, <unk> in a corner of my closet dark <unk> my gay, and the move only one muscle is the scariest scary I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers with the ones that I've spent my entire life trying to be <unk> and now the world turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my <unk> got more memorable wedding my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to know that I was gay, and when I was doing my musician <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents were my parents, people who knew me for years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women were <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and it's never talked about having <unk>
So what is your TV TV show.
Our <unk> Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing you desperately his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk> shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you will be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you want.
So that's how hard conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through a gay perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any direction is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the armor. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others need to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> simply <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You would never get rid of that.
And some of them can go wounded secure, <unk> so they have done, but they're never sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not his own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark closet to a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this it was done as a critique of the computer pioneers in computer like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we made a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a walk.
We start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you are from a race race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at Earth, and they have incredibly long telescopes, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save us ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth's intelligence -- you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, at some point in time, the asteroids that would be <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finely finely at developing intelligence, and in particular, for developing states that would undermine the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different kinds of themes and <unk> together, I asked, for a number of years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we could extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for intelligence <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, yes, to an imminent time, <unk>
In a nutshell, to intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep open choices.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
Do you understand the level of human <unk>
Are the <unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to more favorable conditions for intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection, <unk> between entropy and intelligence and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you find in.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence, play the game games, and they even earn money <unk> and all of it without being used to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing with no <unk> here we see a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it to <unk> a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have apps for <unk> robotics and human assistance.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, as a few other animals can cooperate throwing away by opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, you see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we successfully play a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> <unk> new connections to a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the Web right around.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we can spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiating actions, in increasing assets in its exponentially.
This ability to venture risk will have vast apps in finance, safe <unk>
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different human human behaviors such as the use of tools, walk upright and social cooperation -- all derived from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here is a profound irony.
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> <unk> there was always the concept that if you were having smart machines there would have an rebellion that would have been <unk>
Machines were <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion going to the other way around.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then they try to take over the world.
It's all the way that the impulse to take the control of all future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of general intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking the control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
And they often ask me, how do you look for goals that are <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go through the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, it's the following: The intelligence must be the following: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid restrictions on their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended our insights to how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The science mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one among the billions of planets from our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope, which measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars, when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that will get us.
The data gathered by Kepler showing the size of the planets besides the distance that there is between them and their mother.
So together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that receives from their <unk>
Instead, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this trove of virtual worlds that are potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest recorded.
<unk> ice and the sea ice that you've been with us for now since millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale to our ability to disrupt our course.
But I'm not the weather scientist of weather, or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, hoping to find places in the universe where we discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially reasonable world to show this for a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, it's because of it that we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> as the <unk> are tracking its surface looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> that <unk> like the <unk> mission are taking samples from the atmosphere and trying to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now provide not just short space flight but also <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> we remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and <unk> ideas compared to the Earth, Mars is a rather terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still going to be <unk> places really compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> places on the Earth, the air is fresh, and it's filled with oxygen from the tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this kind of excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag them with a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars would expect to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
And so I like to like the exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is as a imagine that the captain of the Titanic will have gone later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of trying to preserve and improve life in the future.
<unk> environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and coastal zones of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with a <unk> experiment, the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked myself, having realized that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Okay, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are protecting this development.
It's arrogant to think that just the colonization of us -- we will save us from ourselves, but general preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to address the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
And a few years ago, I had my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the dining table, where there was <unk>
So quickly tried to open up all the other other doors and windows, and they were all good closed.
I thought I call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night because he had an early flight in Europe in the next morning, and <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but it's sure not more expensive than an <unk> at the middle of the day, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, I'm very well over.
I'm a career neurologist and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> which increases the heart rhythm, and the adrenaline and the adrenaline levels are thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in her place, which were going to place bad things going on.
Or at least if bad things happen, you know, the probability of total catastrophe happening.
So I set up to think about that, but a month later, my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective with me.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written out of this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, one team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that they could go wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things going on or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the <unk>
In the house, they <unk> a place for the things that you lose easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the right is right, where the fish, that places the <unk> trees, where tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, it would cut the sense out of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose keys from the car, glasses and <unk>
So at home, we had a place for your keys, a hook along with the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For his <unk> a drawer in particular.
For your reading, a <unk> in particular.
If you're going to take a place and you're <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when you <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards, license cards, <unk> <unk> for mail to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress is not at the best time, and we have to put the systems on their site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful than when you're facing a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them make a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of us making medical decisions, and actually for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take away from the fact that they would benefit from the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol thing is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease attack, heart stroke
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even though you are even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do is, a statistic that you should ask for the most physicians who don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to a surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And it should be thinking about what kind of statistic of statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not guilt <unk> and if it's <unk> it's from scientists as I am.
We have not understood the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs is only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number we need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they help someone else help you from helping someone else help you from helping someone else help you from going to help you?"
300.
This is about the research of the cynical cynical researchers and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>
I feel the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before you avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 to go down my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, <unk> <unk>
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include debilitating, muscle pain and chronic pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress doesn't think clearly.
So think about how you get this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking about the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people -- that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get distracted by the drug that helps you help you drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
Cognitive medical ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the <unk> but actually this number needs to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that gets more done in the top of 50 percent of their prostate cancer -- the number necessary prostate cancer, the number needs to deal with is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if it's lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice, a lot of times, you want a shorter life <unk> or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change your view in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> Face with a predator -- it's not necessary for the system of <unk> or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, not quite quickly. They could get the lunch lunch so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we all are <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how those are going to be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to prevent things bad in the first place.
<unk> in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of a combination with a combination of the gate with a key from the gate of entry into the itself, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't <unk> and lots of mail I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite favorite symbol here.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing from a tree of <unk> there it looks like it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never be done to a complete silence.
That is my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the <unk> American system, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The French language language came over the decade in 1800, and over time, he mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a brain world is as if I lived in a foreign world, following the rules out of their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk>
So how do I understand that?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I have learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people die.
So, I have learned for example -- example.
<unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise like eating the bag of potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, you make sure not <unk> <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's going to come next.
Hence this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> to move on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> don't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds across the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do my thumb with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic home there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
Over this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all auditory art.
Now sound has come into my realm of art.
Is it going to be more <unk>
I realized that it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that so well that we don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or I can experience something visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that I had taught me about the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, he was overwhelmed with the number of support and attention that I had.
I realized sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a lazy person.
And sound is so powerful that I would well be able to lie to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you about it.
I chose to make me angry.
There's a massive culture around speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from equal to become my voice.
In that way, I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and <unk>
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for your voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan to a very high interest rate.
If I won't continue with this practice, I feel that I could get it on the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and to express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning both of the signals as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor on the piano, so you can understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide into many different <unk>
If you're assigned to a different parameter for each finger while the piano, as you touch the piano, as the facial expression, the body movement, the speed movement, the speed, the shape of hand, and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it's just <unk> only one key at the time.
But the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the place to express a concept or a sense of <unk>
If only one button would change the <unk> it would create a completely different means.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different <unk> parameters you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started to think, and if I see <unk> through the lenses through music?
If I had to create a sign and get it over and again and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is a sign of <unk> the sun comes out and he's wearing.
This is <unk>
If you look at it, and you <unk> the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a long time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing that is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, I went back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of <unk> <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do that with me?
All of the hands at all.
Now we're going to do it both on your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yes, so good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the signs of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this: Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again, again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
And look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen on your head and the chest but they make it very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
Yet today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have any social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, no sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learning <unk> not that you have to hear music.
The <unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can do it all, but then you've got to get it out.
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of an innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults lied to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I was older, I found out that adults also learn that the adults were also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up the others.
The time country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk around the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, we have been coming up with these plastic pieces to actually study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and the <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it is very expensive and it's also very risky to use those large components.
So along with my students, in six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> job <unk> so that the children very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
So let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it in the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to push them into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces of plastic, only information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids get a lot with the robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned the light lights, and the Internet cameras are going to come up in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see those plastic chunks floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I went on this step step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would take it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they were trying to fix it immediately.
And so I wanted to investigate my problem <unk> But my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, you look at the Internet, and you get involved with this image: right?
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands of oil, in <unk> the world's largest <unk> in Bangladesh.
And they were really surprised because this is the water you drink is the water where you get rid of the water where the water gets in.
You can also see that water is brown -- the mud and oil are also brown color and when everybody <unk> it's very difficult to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We got this prototype with a sensor and we sent them to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away and maybe address a more difficult problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it went to various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives nuclear power plant from Fukushima, nuclear nuclear <unk>
And today, according to the news reports about 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that the bulk of the radiation disappeared away from the coast of <unk> and most of the time, it has a safe thing, it's blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and design independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course we don't know the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night we reported to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like not to do the serious work, but I did do it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all of his life.
Together with them, we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do after, the <unk> the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a map of the region of the region around the nuclear plant plant.
We created the map of <unk> we introduced pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive powder is thrown away from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an estimate of <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the nearest <unk> to the date.
We are approaching a mile away from the nuclear station, and with the fishing help of the area were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so small and so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and convert it into the larger space dedicated to social impact on social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology -- basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with help in adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the old age population transforming their standard signature chairs into new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave to our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So ordinary citizens creators, we need to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of steel pieces of steel -- the other one thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is placed on the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the marble <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that was free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that was required for every cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have made a world made out of the world, and the imagination of designers and architects and trained trained to think about their objects as <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk>
Think of the human skin for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pores with it.
The <unk> of the back are cheaper.
You do mostly as a filter, the other mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every single designer and an architect to work on between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and right, shown in the two screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, stepping away from the assembly and go down to growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special time in history, a rare moment -- where it was <unk> four disciplines that give designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believed in.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We are designing objects, products, structures and tools through scale, scale scale, like this robotic arm with a 24 meters in diameter with an app that someday that someday is not very far from print buildings, and graphics to nanoscale made of genetically <unk>
So here we have <unk> <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every opening is the only size of the light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the ability to create a layer and a <unk> this was for a fashion fashion from Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator we print this layer and <unk> this layer and <unk> with the cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines <unk> materials and <unk> on the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution, <unk> and <unk> instruments that are allowing us to design products that are characterized by not just the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair one chair to comfortable structural, comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
The teacher Carter -- my collaborator went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern <unk> becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different <unk> vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, it changes its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between eating branches, leaves and <unk>
All the tree.
Instead, the land made up trees with branches, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
And I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if the objects were done by the <unk>
I went to a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material -- the kind of material of the tree of the <unk> tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons are produced every year by wired and shrimp, and <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We were asking a bunch of apple husks and the <unk> and produced toothpaste.
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures at a large scale, you built a system with multiple noise from <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of one material -- <unk> -- 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain microorganisms <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet making a billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria genetically engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems that are <unk> to mesh and if it expanded even more, to window.
A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first life forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with very synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed to make them put in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they will grow a tree.
<unk> to our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the ability to create clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the Blank <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals that were <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels into channels very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other use sugar and it produces biofuels to the built environment.
But these two grandchildren, don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never was <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract -- that will help you flow these bacteria and that they will bring their way around.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material as <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, photosynthesis, channels <unk>
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch from one end to each other, it's about 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our very thin.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures only half is <unk>
What if the design is going to do the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase matter, alive?
And if we were able to create personal <unk> that we put our skin, they will destroy our skin <unk> and our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer is looking at <unk> material.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly progressive architecture, a home in which it is <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is not <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts of structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, they put those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first gets into the environment, create a tension, structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to figure out how this process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a Gordian worm.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm.
However, by putting the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they would take a flat, and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly from the environment.
Often the silk worms are going to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the brutal silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot that we had to make silk, and we put it in our site.
We knew that silk worms are going into the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat down, distributing the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We were looking for silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to be prepared with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they went down, pack eggs, and the life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said the tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By adding biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other fills gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us to form a <unk> ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
It brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new design era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us to a design inspired by nature by nature that is inspired by us, for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can stick with your toes.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be from <unk>
They've caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school, I liked the English and the <unk> and the art and he went back and put the guitar websites, and I was playing guitar guitar.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it out.
But then I was going to focus on something else, something completely different, and I get rid of it, and I let me absorb and feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I was not sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denial all my other passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have happened then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did, they learned about culture.
The first question: "What do you want to be from <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what I was doing at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers to kids like, to be <unk> or to be <unk> or want to be <unk>
It was <unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
So this question is a question over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, you ask them to go to the university.
And at some point, what do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the nice exercise of before what you take away the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what might be, is not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it is right in the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>   and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy was editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something that you spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different different issues that come up with their curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel itself.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many other interests and creative activities.
It's a breath that he say.
It could help if you divide in three <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can think of the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who it was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or distress that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
There are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his interests shared in cartography, visualizing data, and traveling mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
There's the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of their background can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second <unk> <unk> is learning fast.
When we get them, we become <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> for having a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our zones of comfort.
A lot of skills are attached to other disciplines, and we bring everything we have learned to every new area that we need, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> at full time and an independent writer.
As a child pianist <unk> an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the fastest sales mechanics when he was starting their thumb, and this ability helps to write compelling the editors.
It rarely is a waste of time to go to what you can tell you, even if you finally read it.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a whole different field, a way that you could not have <unk>
The third <unk> <unk> is adaptability. That is the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, a web designer designer -- sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take up different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
The Magazine Magazine Company as the most important skill for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet to meet the needs of the market, which is really <unk>
<unk> of ideas and quickly learning and <unk> three skills where they <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster them as they are themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they're in your heart, <unk>
They came out of the belly by knowing that they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams came up with a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep deep and put in practice ideas, and the <unk> provides a width of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to happen with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> largely being told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you take away from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you will give the best of yes.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep her curious for those <unk> of <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a better and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year they were <unk> a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric psychiatric situation.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for it until that, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
And even more astonishing ones.
If I had been alive today, we couldn't give it more help her more help her more help him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk>
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But recently, it's been progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Malaria is now affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live as much as 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of the two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you have to pass their years away with Alzheimer's disease or helping to take care of a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
Already in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- a <unk> increase in the year 2050, as the generation of <unk> booms <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's disease is the only one that cannot be <unk> cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more year on cancer research than Alzheimer's disease in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a double number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but everybody else -- Alzheimer's world is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of us, even even scientists, <unk> <unk> with aging.
We think that we will become <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only a picture of a healthy brain of a healthy brain compared to the HIV patient.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly reduces life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For nearly a century, we didn't know much about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these dots -- they end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay outside the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of which step to block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step to the right thing, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the people have reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> and physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process, and now it's testing a new kind of drugs that engaged specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that they stick in each other in them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they were <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a good results, but research like this show that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and fix.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, from overcoming the disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we add it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have topped more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug companies and <unk>
That was essential to advance the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit for overcoming cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and loved ones are often too <unk> to come out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's disease is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients as <unk> which cannot create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking to them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The paper comes from a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to try and test it as a last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers were <unk> to get 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or ability, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you went back to someone else.
And <unk>
And <unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal and more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about him or her, I know really honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, one detail really struck me attention, the gossip that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with somebody who I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
Yet we were <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column, Love a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking you guys to go together and go together.
And the reason I think you ask this is because I've been asking me this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had tried to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that has found a good attention of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But we had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and already Saturday Saturday, this was happening on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I've already called me today: Show me and "Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article got over eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing honestly about bare own experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks for weeks, the same question: are still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And various messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed until the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for Saint <unk> that included the experience of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
And I took television interviews, and <unk> the requests for photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if we really wanted to know if I was able to produce love <unk> not just an adventure, but love <unk> love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going to get it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of doing these sorts less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was trying to encourage interpersonal approach, between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic -- right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer after doing several studies -- number several <unk> studies, they also used <unk> protocol as well as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it among members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people of <unk> political <unk>
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university -- and then a student approached me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He looked like <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you would get you from the person who you <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
They knew that they were able to get better after we tried the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to virtually my whole adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I took myself to science.
And so I did everything I could find about romantic love, and I expected that that could a certain form of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just worked for the book that I wrote -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was built with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used to feel as bad as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love, I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I came from.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you can ask me to me.
So what I'm looking for of love is a <unk> not just to be love today and to be a love morning, but they will continue to be loved indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to somehow mitigate something of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And the content with an answer.
So more than a question, we would ask us to ask questions, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things become <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship? Or even more, how you live in the question of your <unk>
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more comfortable conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still have a few romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same as being <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article, <unk> love didn't happen.
They had fallen in love with <unk> because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was no matter what that choice was supposed to be.
And I didn't think a few times we would have both to make that decision, and how much times I have to keep making that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and I responded in the question, I have chosen to love somebody as generous, kind and fun and fun and have expressed that election in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think about.
And what I'm going to do, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy eye implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also would love, and it's <unk> but that's a <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some <unk> in full mountain, and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
<unk> New York City a time ago --  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
So I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar ticket and a dollar, and a fork on it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of the strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species -- ideas, for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from travel and <unk> and all these things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> I went to the Agnes Martin, I covered the resin and a bee still <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added a more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened, in some way it seemed to rise as a size, as if it was that I used the text with a <unk>
So I did I <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add some electronic elements, weird tools, weird bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out, and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow out of drawing as well as it does around a <unk> <unk>
And I took out the objects and I created my own <unk> of specimens from <unk>
First of all, you can get an idea.
Then I made a lot of insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
He was great man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, sculptures of <unk> of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass layers -- similar to the drawing on a window and then another window window, and he had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work would be <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by much as in "The <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
Are you going to be the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh where you <unk>
This is where the creatures with heads of animals are heading to the <unk> ready for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all sorts of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like an mythological thing that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a narrative.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird bird, and it spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a <unk> of snake that unites the <unk>
But anyway, your tail turn on fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made from terrorist cards, 1986.
They've been <unk>
They were made in the 1980, as if they were baseball cards from the terrorists.
Very <unk> for your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in 20 or 12 to the time.
They're like cells, come together, divide up.
And you can walk between them. I'm taking a few years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human sitting inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's my chest, you can get the entrance to it.
I'm going to share the waterfall for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or whatever it is, you have a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't take it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see it.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This has two heads shift, and it's communicating between the two.
There are a bunch of pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box, there's a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a writer, a museum, a museum, a museum, a museum, a museum, a <unk> arm that spreads all the content we do in the world; and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people in hits each other as a particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get older, who is and the box that he is living in.
And together we came to realize that all of us are together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have effect against pain, first goes through your stomach, your bowels and other organs.
I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any foreign drug is in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug gets sick.
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs, they are able to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the stem cells themselves.
But they are also known by their side effects <unk> in its vast majority of negative, because in the time that it takes you to get to the current stream -- it gets <unk> and worse than the time it takes to get to your destiny, which is where it's most important to get to your destiny, which is where it is most important in the store of HIV.
These are regions in the body like the <unk> <unk> system, the lungs, where the virus is slowing down, and it doesn't happen to be easily in the stream of blood in the patients that are being tested in regular therapy with antiretroviral therapy of drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can awaken and infect new cells to use.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for lifespan by <unk>
And one day, I sat down, and I thought, "We have to get the treatment directly to the virus store without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and surgery of diabetes, you can use it for anything, including shipping drug transporting drugs.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, which opens up and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce the medication.
The best thing they ask -- "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of a <unk> <unk> laser beam on the cell membrane living by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains drug medicine.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in terms of <unk>
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's going to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head is a <unk> which distributes the drug -- it releases it directly into the space of infection, while the laser is using new to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't look very much at time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
And so they were doing what these groups are doing when they're not shoot down.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to confrontation not violent.
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between the states and the non-governmental actors.
For example, from the <unk> peace peace peace between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to be <unk> or <unk> in any successful control process.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known by its violent clash against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s -- <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military system.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian Palestinian -- known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
They're multitasking things.
<unk> a complex machinery of <unk> stations of radio channels and radio channels and strategies of social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools and run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state <unk> security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Canadian Afghanistan or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can be able to be able to also see the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price between the population.
But in general, provide social services that means filling out a vacuum -- a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 in Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid <unk>
<unk> because they fill existing gaps by the government, and emerge as armed and political groups, engage in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated organizations are these organizations, we can <unk> as something to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
It's part of a territory of a territory, running all of their function, they collect the trash, and run the <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nation without state and hybrids and the weaker ones that are states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the <unk> actors <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in the aquatic tools.
<unk> the government of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better what incentives to provide to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new <unk> between states and non-state actors, military power can win some fights, but we don't give peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum of safety, to fill that empty government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions on gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to take openly the label on <unk> it would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I was struck by as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young kid, especially in my youth and the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men who hated sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> who might be feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a nasty word.
It was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking for too much, with high self-worth and <unk> to believe that it's like or <unk>
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They took the same wages for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as it <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have right to use it easy to use it in easy and accessible control and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> and a lot of more.
We need to look at these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music <unk> down volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and the letter degrades it deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin -- yang <unk> is incredible.
Do you actually have your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely overwhelmed by my musical hair.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the <unk> of the grass and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy tales that they do reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, is his election, and I am not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I agreed that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it causes women to be economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color women and gay and gay and <unk> for white women, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist thing.
And as it happens, as <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we're going to make perfect work.
When we were <unk> they were very comfortable from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to get rid of that <unk> before I try and put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative innovators and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> because of fear that means that tag for fear that it means not to be able to fulfill the unusual expectations.
Let's take an example to <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
Over the last few years is a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> in <unk> went in front of the word <unk> of three feet tall.
It was a show of <unk> to see this star star embracing the feminism and making women and the young men who become a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics began a lot of endless arguments if <unk> was or not a feminist.
It will take its feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk>
<unk> perfection is because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go far beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or rather, one feminism more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change in which they actually affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify the worst choice.
But when bad decisions get rid of this that makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, and equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls <unk> <unk> and very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
Where they were told by the strong creatures that they are.
And I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will become a lot easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't deal with women than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes are treating their companions as <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men who can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, participate in your project, or work with you, until you don't have a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your desktop or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we were able to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also help them be even more as more as we are being able to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we are not groupers <unk> without these efforts, without adopting these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to get to the top, to the people in the power of directors and music producers and music, to <unk> the people who can make bigger decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also be able to claim our feminism, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell him about everything, because I was <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me."
There was one incident.
I call it an incident in front of what happened.
And a few kids would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I don't want to believe that I might say something that might matter.
But I was typing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant living in this world if you have the brown skin in this world.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it wasn't nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and from feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could be <unk> and see that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to accomplish anything.
And in the other, I am holding the <unk> reality.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we all can be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after last year, <unk> children in California had measles for having visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, to over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that measles may be terrible for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak were not vaccinated because their parents were really afraid of something that was supposed to be still <unk> autism.
But a moment -- it wasn't the article that the argument the argument about autism and the <unk> vaccines and marked and marked by being an fraud, by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her create his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued to be stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising <unk> like <unk> <unk> are about routinely about autism as an HIV epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
So if you ask the people at the Centers for Disease Control from Atlanta -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't have a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be asked, why were they so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow and <unk> progress of the science that we have to say to the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story about autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with an infant psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could do fun for hours waving their hands on their face, but they were prey to <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toy in its usual place without knowing it.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the primary authority of the world in the subject, declared that I'd seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as distant as <unk> references as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, I will give that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was realized that he had turned to nine out of 10 children sent out for other doctors to his doctor's office, without giving a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
We hired autism as a form of child disease, caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have stayed carefully in a refrigerator that we didn't know.
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of her young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite <unk> he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills affirming things like the children were simply giving up what they had heard of their parents -- desperate to win.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, turning invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of women's <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl as a <unk> No special education, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Service Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
<unk> a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
I took a suburb from London called <unk> to try and find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clearly clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or at genealogy of <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> like <unk> said and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
Early on, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did no one have had these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then it was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he was <unk> for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a comprehensive clinic with a school school in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises with music, and kids followed their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a lifelong disability, for life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, <unk> he calls their little teachers, and he started helping in the development of education methods that were particularly suited for them.
And <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of operators and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architectural culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
Judith and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with autism that autism was <unk> as well as parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic criteria that we would promote the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes come into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a broad array of Asperger's and <unk>
These changes fell on a broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked backstage to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> acting in <unk> acting as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents and fathers of all the world knew what about autism.
At the same time, it was introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her child.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were hoping that it was, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming vaccines for the rise of the <unk> and a simple, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful story as bad as the autism theory that autism was <unk>
If the estimate of the heart of prevention of prevention that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right. <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the medical breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows -- it doesn't mean it's cut.
According to the standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to details.
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that it creates that <unk> for the world's most deprived aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
